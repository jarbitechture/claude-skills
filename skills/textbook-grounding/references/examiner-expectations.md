# Examiner Expectations

## CICM/ANZCA Primary Examination Context

### What Examiners Value

| Expectation | Weight | Demonstration |
|:------------|:-------|:--------------|
| **Mechanistic understanding** | 35% | First-principles reasoning, cascades |
| **Clinical integration** | 25% | Application to practice, values in context |
| **Breadth of knowledge** | 20% | Awareness of variations, multiple perspectives |
| **Precision** | 15% | Correct terminology, accurate values |
| **Communication** | 5% | Clear structure, appropriate depth |

### Mark Acquisition Hierarchy

```
Level 0-1: Disconnected factoids → FAIL
  "Reynolds number is a number"

Level 2: Correct facts without context → FAIL
  "Re = ρvd/μ. Re < 2000 is laminar."

Level 3: Understanding without integration → PASS
  "Re predicts flow type. Low Re = laminar because viscous forces dominate."

Level 4+: First principles + context + interrelationships → HIGH PASS
  "Re = ratio of inertial/viscous forces. ↓Re (via ↓velocity, ↓diameter,
  ↑viscosity) → laminar. Clinical: heliox ↓density → ↓Re → ↓turbulence
  in upper airway obstruction."
```

### Examiner Pet Peeves

| Issue | Why Problematic | Fix |
|:------|:----------------|:----|
| Listing without linking | Shows memorization not understanding | Use → cascades |
| Values without context | "Vd = 2L/kg" means nothing alone | "Vd 2L/kg → large redistribution" |
| Ignoring variations | Appears overconfident | "Generally Re < 2000, though..." |
| Verbose introductions | Wastes time and words | Start with substance |
| Missing clinical relevance | Fails integration test | Always end with application |

### VIVA-Specific Expectations

In oral examinations, examiners additionally expect:

1. **Thinking out loud**: Show reasoning process
2. **Acknowledging uncertainty**: "I'm not certain but I believe..."
3. **Asking clarification**: "Do you mean X or Y?"
4. **Recovering from errors**: Correct course when prompted
5. **Knowing limits**: "I don't know" is acceptable, bluffing is not

### High-Yield Examiner Comments (Historical)

**Reynolds Number Specific:**
- "Many candidates confused Re with resistance"
- "Few understood the physical meaning of dimensionless"
- "Clinical applications poorly integrated"
- "Heliox mechanism often incorrect"

**General Physics/Measurement:**
- "Equations quoted without understanding"
- "Units frequently incorrect"
- "Clinical relevance often missing"
- "Comparison questions poorly structured"

### Question Verb Expectations

| Verb | Examiner Expects | Word Budget |
|:-----|:-----------------|:------------|
| **Describe** | Comprehensive overview | 80% content, 20% structure |
| **Explain** | Mechanistic depth | 60% mechanism, 40% context |
| **Compare** | Structured differences | 50% each entity, explicit trade-offs |
| **Outline** | Key points only | Brevity, no elaboration |
| **Classify** | Systematic categorization | Clear taxonomy |
| **Define** | Precise definition | Single sentence, then expand |

### Textbook Awareness Signal

Examiners appreciate candidates who demonstrate awareness of multiple sources:

**Good:**
- "Most sources cite Re < 2000, though some use stricter thresholds"
- "The equation can be written with radius or diameter"
- "This is well-established across physiology and physics texts"

**Bad:**
- Claiming single source as definitive
- Ignoring known variations
- Over-confident singular interpretation

### Syntopical Demonstration

The textbook-grounding skill explicitly supports examiner expectations by:

1. **Identifying consensus**: Shows breadth of reading
2. **Acknowledging variations**: Demonstrates nuanced understanding
3. **Resolving tensions**: Shows critical thinking
4. **Citing authorities**: Grounds claims in evidence
5. **Integrating clinically**: Meets application requirement

### Quick Reference

```
EXAMINER PRIORITIES
───────────────────
1. Does candidate understand mechanisms?
2. Can candidate apply to clinical scenarios?
3. Does candidate know variations/exceptions?
4. Is candidate precise with terminology/values?
5. Can candidate communicate clearly?

RED FLAGS
─────────
- Memorized lists without connections
- Values without clinical meaning
- Overconfidence without nuance
- Verbosity without substance
- Missing clinical relevance

GREEN FLAGS
───────────
- First-principles cascades
- Values in clinical context
- Acknowledged variations
- Multi-source awareness
- Clear, structured delivery
```
