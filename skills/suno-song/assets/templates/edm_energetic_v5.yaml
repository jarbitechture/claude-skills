bar_count_guidance:
  intro: "32 bars typical (1 minute at 128 BPM)"
  build: "16 bars (30 seconds)"
  drop: "32 bars (1 minute)"

typical_elements:
  tempo: "Fast (125-145 BPM, 128 most common)"
  energy: "High throughout, peaks at drops"

  instrumentation:
    essential: "Synth bass (sub bass + mid bass layers)"

    percussion: "Punchy kick, crisp hi-hats, claps"
    fx: "Risers, sweeps, impacts for builds"

lyrical_themes:
  recommended:
    - Euphoria and celebration
    - Unity and connection (rave culture)
    - Freedom and release
    - Love (high-energy, positive)

  edm_style:
    - Short, punchy phrases

    - Emotional but not complex narratives

  avoid:
    - Complex storytelling (save for verses if any)
    - Melancholic or sad themes (mood conflict)
    - Overly wordy lyrics (interferes with drops)

common_pitfalls:
  - "DON'T use 'calm' or 'peaceful' tags (conflicts with high energy)"
  - "AVOID acoustic instruments unless specific fusion intent"
  - "DON'T make vocals too complex during drops (instrumental focus)"
  - "AVOID slow tempos (EDM needs energy)"

v5_specific_tips:
  - "V5 synth sounds are CLEAN and professional"
  - "Euphoric/joyful emotion tags enhance peak moments (85% reliability)"
  - "Drop sections benefit from inline hints: '[Drop] [maximum energy]'"
  - "Build-up → Drop transition: V5 handles automatically (trust the AI)"
  - "If drop lacks impact, use Replace Section with 'more energetic, heavier bass'"
  - "Vocals in drops: Keep simple or use chopped samples"
