# Kaizen: Continuous Improvement

Apply continuous improvement mindset - suggest small iterative improvements, error-proof designs, follow established patterns, avoid over-engineering; automatically applied to guide quality and simplicity

## Overview

Small improvements, continuously. Error-proof by design. Follow what works. Build only what's needed.

**Core principle:** Many small improvements beat one big change. Prevent errors at design time, not with fixes.

## When to Use

**Always applied for:**

- Code implementation and refactoring
- Architecture and design decisions
- Process and workflow improvements
- Error handling and validation

**Philosophy:** Quality through incremental progress and prevention, not perfection through massive effort.

## The Four Pillars

1. **Continuous Improvement (Kaizen)**: Small, frequent improvements compound into major gains
2. **Poka-Yoke (Error Proofing)**: Design systems that prevent errors rather than detect them
3. **Standardized Work**: Follow established patterns and conventions consistently
4. **Just-In-Time (JIT)**: Build only what's needed when it's needed
