## Integration with Commands

The Kaizen skill guides how you work. The commands provide structured analysis:

- **`/why`**: Root cause analysis (5 Whys)
- **`/cause-and-effect`**: Multi-factor analysis (Fishbone)
- **`/plan-do-check-act`**: Iterative improvement cycles
- **`/analyse-problem`**: Comprehensive documentation (A3)
- **`/analyse`**: Smart method selection (Gemba/VSM/Muda)

Use commands for structured problem-solving. Apply skill for day-to-day development.

## Red Flags

**Violating Continuous Improvement:**

- "I'll refactor it later" (never happens)
- Leaving code worse than you found it
- Big bang rewrites instead of incremental

**Violating Poka-Yoke:**

- "Users should just be careful"
- Validation after use instead of before
- Optional config with no validation

**Violating Standardized Work:**

- "I prefer to do it my way"
- Not checking existing patterns
- Ignoring project conventions

**Violating Just-In-Time:**

- "We might need this someday"
- Building frameworks before using them
- Optimizing without measuring

## Remember

**Kaizen is about:**

- Small improvements continuously
- Preventing errors by design
- Following proven patterns
- Building only what's needed

**Not about:**

- Perfection on first try
- Massive refactoring projects
- Clever abstractions
- Premature optimization

**Mindset:** Good enough today, better tomorrow. Repeat.
