Reference

# Authentication

Cursor CLI supports two authentication methods: browser-based login (recommended) and API keys.

## [Browser authentication (recommended)](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/reference/authentication\#browser-authentication-recommended)

Use the browser flow for the easiest authentication experience:

```
# Log in using browser flow
cursor-agent login

# Check authentication status
cursor-agent status

# Log out and clear stored authentication
cursor-agent logout
```

The login command will open your default browser and prompt you to authenticate with your Cursor account. Once completed, your credentials are securely stored locally.

## [API key authentication](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/reference/authentication\#api-key-authentication)

For automation, scripts, or CI/CD environments, use API key authentication:

### [Step 1: Generate an API key](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/reference/authentication\#step-1-generate-an-api-key)

Generate an API key in your Cursor dashboard under Integrations > User API Keys.

### [Step 2: Set the API key](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/reference/authentication\#step-2-set-the-api-key)

You can provide the API key in two ways:

**Option 1: Environment variable (recommended)**

```
export CURSOR_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
cursor-agent "implement user authentication"
```

**Option 2: Command line flag**

```
cursor-agent --api-key your_api_key_here "implement user authentication"
```

## [Authentication status](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/reference/authentication\#authentication-status)

Check your current authentication status:

```
cursor-agent status
```

This command will display:

- Whether you're authenticated
- Your account information
- Current endpoint configuration

## [Troubleshooting](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/reference/authentication\#troubleshooting)

- **"Not authenticated" errors:** Run `cursor-agent login` or ensure your API key is correctly set
- **SSL certificate errors:** Use the `--insecure` flag for development environments
- **Endpoint issues:** Use the `--endpoint` flag to specify a custom API endpoint

# Bugbot

Bugbot reviews pull requests and identifies bugs, security issues, and code quality problems.

Bugbot includes a free tier: every user gets a limited number of free PR reviews each month. When you reach the limit, reviews pause until your next billing cycle. You can upgrade anytime to a 14‑day free Pro trial for unlimited reviews (subject to standard abuse guardrails).

## [How it works](https://cursor.com/docs/bugbot\#how-it-works)

Bugbot analyzes PR diffs and leaves comments with explanations and fix suggestions. It runs automatically on each PR update or manually when triggered.

- Runs **automatic reviews** on every PR update
- **Manual trigger** by commenting `cursor review` or `bugbot run` on any PR
- **Uses existing PR comments as context**: reads GitHub PR comments (top‑level and inline) to avoid duplicate suggestions and build on prior feedback
- **Fix in Cursor** links open issues directly in Cursor
- **Fix in Web** links open issues directly in [cursor.com/agents](https://cursor.com/agents)

## [Setup](https://cursor.com/docs/bugbot\#setup)

Requires Cursor admin access and GitHub org admin access.

1. Go to [cursor.com/dashboard](https://cursor.com/dashboard?tab=bugbot)
2. Navigate to the Bugbot tab
3. Click `Connect GitHub` (or `Manage Connections` if already connected)
4. Follow the GitHub installation flow
5. Return to the dashboard to enable Bugbot on specific repositories

## [Configuration](https://cursor.com/docs/bugbot\#configuration)

IndividualTeam

### [Repository settings](https://cursor.com/docs/bugbot\#repository-settings-1)

Team admins can enable Bugbot per repository, configure allow/deny lists for reviewers, and set:

- Run **only once** per PR per installation, skipping subsequent commits
- **Disable inline reviews** to prevent Bugbot from leaving comments directly on code lines

Bugbot runs for all contributors to enabled repositories, regardless of team membership.

### [Personal settings](https://cursor.com/docs/bugbot\#personal-settings-1)

Team members can override settings for their own PRs:

- Run **only when mentioned** by commenting `cursor review` or `bugbot run`
- Run **only once** per PR, skipping subsequent commits
- **Enable reviews on draft PRs** to include draft pull requests in automatic reviews

### [Analytics](https://cursor.com/docs/bugbot\#analytics)

![Bugbot dashboard](https://cursor.com/docs-static/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs-static%2Fimages%2Fbugbot%2Fbugbot-dashboard.png&w=1920&q=75)

## [Rules](https://cursor.com/docs/bugbot\#rules)

Create `.cursor/BUGBOT.md` files to provide project-specific context for reviews. Bugbot always includes the root `.cursor/BUGBOT.md` file and any additional files found while traversing upward from changed files.

```
project/
  .cursor/BUGBOT.md          # Always included (project-wide rules)
  backend/
    .cursor/BUGBOT.md        # Included when reviewing backend files
    api/
      .cursor/BUGBOT.md      # Included when reviewing API files
  frontend/
    .cursor/BUGBOT.md        # Included when reviewing frontend files
```

### [Team rules](https://cursor.com/docs/bugbot\#team-rules)

Team admins can create rules from the [Bugbot dashboard](https://cursor.com/dashboard?tab=bugbot) that apply to all repositories in the team. These rules are available to every enabled repository, making it easy to enforce organization-wide standards.

When both Team Rules and project rule files ( `.cursor/BUGBOT.md`) exist, Bugbot uses both. They are applied in this order: **Team Rules → project BUGBOT.md (including nested files) → User Rules**.

### [Examples](https://cursor.com/docs/bugbot\#examples)

### Security: Flag any use of eval() or exec()

### OSS licenses: Prevent importing disallowed licenses

### Language standards: Flag React componentWillMount usage

### Standards: Require tests for backend changes

### Style: Disallow TODO comments

## [Pricing](https://cursor.com/docs/bugbot\#pricing)

Bugbot offers two tiers: **Free** and **Pro**.

### [Free tier](https://cursor.com/docs/bugbot\#free-tier)

Every user gets a limited number of free PR reviews each month. For teams, each team member gets their own free reviews. When you reach the limit, reviews pause until your next billing cycle. You can upgrade anytime to the 14‑day free Pro trial for unlimited reviews.

### [Pro tier](https://cursor.com/docs/bugbot\#pro-tier)

IndividualsTeams

### [Per-user billing](https://cursor.com/docs/bugbot\#per-user-billing)

Teams pay $40 per user per month for unlimited reviews.

We count a user as someone who authored PRs reviewed by Bugbot in a month.

All licenses are relinquished at the start of each billing cycle, and will be assigned out on a first-come, first-served basis. If a user doesn't author any PRs reviewed by Bugbot in a month, the seat can be used by another user.

### [Seat limits](https://cursor.com/docs/bugbot\#seat-limits)

Team admins can set maximum Bugbot seats per month to control costs.

### [Getting started](https://cursor.com/docs/bugbot\#getting-started-1)

Subscribe through your team dashboard to enable billing.

### [Abuse guardrails](https://cursor.com/docs/bugbot\#abuse-guardrails)

In order to prevent abuse, we have a pooled cap of 200 pull requests per month for every Bugbot license. If you need more than 200 pull requests per month, please contact us at [hi@cursor.com](mailto:hi@cursor.com) and we'll be happy to help you out.

For example, if your team has 100 users, your organization will initially be able to review 20,000 pull requests per month. If you reach that limit naturally, please reach out to us and we'll be happy to increase the limit.

## [Troubleshooting](https://cursor.com/docs/bugbot\#troubleshooting)

If Bugbot isn't working:

1. **Enable verbose mode** by commenting `cursor review verbose=true` or `bugbot run verbose=true` for detailed logs and request ID
2. **Check permissions** to verify Bugbot has repository access
3. **Verify installation** to confirm the GitHub app is installed and enabled

Include the request ID from verbose mode when reporting issues.

## [FAQ](https://cursor.com/docs/bugbot\#faq)

### Does Bugbot read GitHub PR comments?

### Is Bugbot privacy-mode compliant?

### What happens when I hit the free tier limit?

# Deployment Patterns

This guide covers how to deploy Cursor IDE and CLI tools to developer machines in your organization. Most organizations deploy both the IDE (for daily development work) and the CLI (for automation, CI/CD, and scripting).

For other deployment options like SCM integrations (bugbot, BGA apps) or web-based access, see the relevant integration documentation.

## [IDE deployment with MDM](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/deployment-patterns\#ide-deployment-with-mdm)

Deploy the Cursor IDE to user workstations and enforce policies through Mobile Device Management (MDM) systems.

### [How it works](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/deployment-patterns\#how-it-works)

1. Your IT team packages Cursor IDE for deployment
2. Push to user machines via MDM (Jamf, Intune, etc.)
3. Users receive Cursor on their primary development machines

MDM allows you to enforce policies on the Cursor IDE, such as allowed team IDs and extensions.

You can also enforce settings like workspace trust, and control auto-updates and deployment of new versions.

### [MDM Configuration](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/deployment-patterns\#mdm-configuration)

You can centrally manage specific features of Cursor through device management solutions to ensure it meets the needs of your organization. When you specify a Cursor policy, its value overrides the corresponding Cursor setting on users' devices.

Cursor currently provides policies to control the following admin-controlled features:

| Policy | Description | Cursor setting |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AllowedExtensions | Controls which extensions can be installed. | `extensions.allowed` |
| AllowedTeamId | Controls which team IDs are allowed to log in. Users with unauthorized team IDs are forcefully logged out. | `cursorAuth.allowedTeamId` |
| ExtensionGalleryServiceUrl | Configures a custom extension marketplace URL. | `extensions.gallery.serviceUrl` |
| NetworkDisableHttp2 | Disables HTTP/2 for all requests, using HTTP/1.1 instead. | `cursor.general.disableHttp2` |
| UpdateMode | Controls automatic update behavior. Set to 'none' to disable updates. | `update.mode` |
| WorkspaceTrustEnabled | Controls whether Workspace Trust is enabled. | `security.workspace.trust.enabled` |

#### [Windows Group Policy](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/deployment-patterns\#windows-group-policy)

Cursor has support for Windows Registry-based Group Policy. When policy definitions are installed, admins can use the Local Group Policy Editor to manage the policy values.

To add a policy:

1. Copy the Policy ADMX and ADML files from `AppData\Local\Programs\cursor\policies`.
2. Paste the ADMX file into the `C:\Windows\PolicyDefinitions` directory, and the ADML file into the `C:\Windows\PolicyDefinitions\<your-locale>\` directory.
3. Restart the Local Group Policy Editor.
4. Set the appropriate policy values (e.g. `{"anysphere": true, "github": true}` for the `AllowedExtensions` policy) in the Local Group Policy Editor.

Policies can be set both at the Computer level and the User level. If both are set, Computer level will take precedence.

**Important:** When a policy value is set, it overrides the Cursor setting value configured at any level (default, user, workspace, etc.). This is a global override that prevents users from changing these settings.

#### [macOS Configuration Profiles](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/deployment-patterns\#macos-configuration-profiles)

Configuration profiles manage settings on macOS devices. A profile is an XML file with key/value pairs that correspond to available policy. These profiles can be deployed using Mobile Device Management (MDM) solutions like Jamf, Kandji, or Microsoft Intune, or installed manually.

**Bundle ID per channel:**

The `PayloadType` in your configuration profile must match the Cursor bundle ID for your channel:

| Channel | Bundle ID |
| --- | --- |
| Production | com.todesktop.230313mzl4w4u92 |
| Nightly | co.anysphere.cursor.nightly |

For most enterprise deployments, use the production bundle ID: `com.todesktop.230313mzl4w4u92`.

### Example .mobileconfig file

##### String policies

The example below demonstrates configuration of the `AllowedExtensions` policy. The policy value starts empty in the sample file (no extensions are allowed).

```
<key>AllowedExtensions</key>
<string></string>
```

Add the appropriate JSON string defining your policy between the `<string>` tags.

```
<key>AllowedExtensions</key>
<string>{"anysphere": true, "github": true}</string>
```

**Extension control semantics:**

The `AllowedExtensions` policy accepts a JSON object where:

- Keys can be publisher names (e.g., `"github"`) or full extension IDs (e.g., `"ms-azuretools.vscode-docker"`)
- Values are booleans indicating whether extensions from that publisher or specific extension are allowed
- If a publisher is set to `true`, all extensions from that publisher are allowed
- Specific extension IDs take precedence over publisher rules

For the `AllowedTeamId` policy, add the comma-separated list of team IDs:

```
<key>AllowedTeamId</key>
<string>1,3,7</string>
```

For the `NetworkDisableHttp2` policy, use a boolean value to disable HTTP/2:

```
<key>NetworkDisableHttp2</key>
<true/>
```

##### UpdateMode policy

The `UpdateMode` policy controls how Cursor handles automatic updates. This is useful for organizations that want to control when and how updates are deployed.

Available values:

- `none` \- Disables all automatic updates
- `manual` \- Users can manually check for updates
- `start` \- Check for updates when Cursor starts
- `default` \- Default behavior (same as `start`)
- `silentlyApplyOnQuit` \- Download updates in the background and apply when Cursor quits

To disable automatic updates:

```
<key>UpdateMode</key>
<string>none</string>
```

##### WorkspaceTrustEnabled policy

The `WorkspaceTrustEnabled` policy controls whether [Workspace Trust](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editing/workspaces/workspace-trust) is enabled. When enabled, Cursor prompts users to choose between normal or restricted mode for new workspaces.

Use a boolean value:

```
<key>WorkspaceTrustEnabled</key>
<true/>
```

##### ExtensionGalleryServiceUrl policy

The `ExtensionGalleryServiceUrl` policy configures the extension marketplace URL. This is useful for organizations that want to use a custom extension marketplace or mirror.

Set the URL as a string value:

```
<key>ExtensionGalleryServiceUrl</key>
<string>https://marketplace.example.com</string>
```

##### Deploying with MDM solutions

The `.mobileconfig` file can be uploaded directly to your MDM solution:

- **Jamf**: Upload as a custom configuration profile
- **Kandji**: Add as a custom profile in Library
- **Microsoft Intune**: Deploy as a custom profile with the correct payload domain

Ensure the `PayloadType` matches your Cursor channel's bundle ID.

##### Reference configuration file

A complete example configuration profile is included with Cursor at:

```
# Production channel
/Applications/Cursor.app/Contents/Resources/app/policies/com.todesktop.230313mzl4w4u92.mobileconfig

# Nightly channel
/Applications/Cursor Nightly.app/Contents/Resources/app/policies/co.anysphere.cursor.nightly.mobileconfig
```

The file path varies by channel. Use the appropriate path for your Cursor installation.

**Important security considerations:**

- The provided `.mobileconfig` file initializes **all** policies available in that version of Cursor
- Delete any policies that are not needed to avoid unintentionally restrictive defaults
- If you do not edit or remove a policy from the sample, that policy will be enforced with its default value
- Policy values override all user and workspace settings globally

Manually install a configuration profile by double-clicking on the `.mobileconfig` profile in Finder and then enabling it in System Preferences under **General** \> **Device Management**. Removing the profile from System Preferences will remove the policies from Cursor.

For more information on configuration profiles, refer to Apple's documentation.

### [Automatic updates for non-admin users](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/deployment-patterns\#automatic-updates-for-non-admin-users)

Due to Electron framework limitations, Cursor updates require administrator privileges on macOS.

**Recommended approaches:**

- **MDM deployment**: Use MDM tools (Jamf, Kandji, Intune) to deploy updates centrally with appropriate privileges
- **Automated deployment tools**: Consider tools like [Installomator](https://github.com/Installomator/Installomator) for scripted updates
- **Disable update prompts**: Set the `UpdateMode` policy to `none` to prevent users from seeing failed update notifications

For organizations with non-admin users, the most reliable approach is to manage Cursor updates through your existing software deployment pipeline and disable automatic updates via MDM policy.

## [CLI deployment](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/deployment-patterns\#cli-deployment)

Run Cursor agents as a headless CLI tool on your infrastructure.

### [How it works](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/deployment-patterns\#how-it-works-1)

1. Deploy the CLI to your environment (on-prem, corporate cloud, Kubernetes clusters, CI/CD systems)
2. The CLI is scripted or run in the background or as part of CI
3. The CLI can access whatever the user can access from their machine (VPN, internal APIs, private package registries, etc.)

### [Installation and setup](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/deployment-patterns\#installation-and-setup)

Install the Cursor CLI:

```
# Install Cursor CLI
curl https://cursor.com/install -fsS | bash

# Set API key for scripts
export CURSOR_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
cursor-agent -p "Analyze this code"
```

See [CLI headless mode documentation](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/headless) for full details.

### [GitHub Actions integration](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/deployment-patterns\#github-actions-integration)

Cursor CLI works in GitHub Actions and other CI systems.

See [GitHub Actions integration](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/github-actions) for examples.

## [Cursor CLI considerations](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/deployment-patterns\#cursor-cli-considerations)

Whether running in the IDE or as a standalone CLI, Cursor agents have the same security controls:

**Same features:**

- Privacy Mode applies equally
- Hooks work for both IDE and CLI
- Same model access controls
- Same audit logging
- Same usage tracking

**Same requirements:**

- Both need network access to Cursor services
- Both send code to LLMs (with Privacy Mode protections)
- Both require appropriate authentication

The CLI is the same agent with a different interface.

## [Network considerations](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/deployment-patterns\#network-considerations)

User machines need access to the following endpoints. Configure firewall and proxy rules accordingly:

- `*.cursor.sh` \- Backend services and API endpoints
- `cursor-cdn.com` \- Application downloads and updates
- `marketplace.cursorapi.com` \- Extension marketplace
- Third-party AI provider endpoints (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.)

When using the `UpdateMode` policy set to `none`, you can restrict access to update endpoints while maintaining access to other services.

The Cursor IDE inherits the machine's network configuration, including VPN access, internal service endpoints, and private package registries.

This means agents running in the IDE can access whatever the user can access from their machine.

See [Network Configuration](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/network-configuration) for detailed firewall and proxy requirements.

# Translate Keys with Cursor CLI

Manage translation keys for internationalization using Cursor CLI. This workflow detects new or changed i18n keys in pull requests and fills missing translations without overwriting existing ones.

**Example: `.github/workflows/translate-keys.yml`**

```
name: Translate Keys

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, ready_for_review]

permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  i18n:
    if: ${{ !startsWith(github.head_ref, 'translate/') }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Install Cursor CLI
        run: |
          curl https://cursor.com/install -fsS | bash
          echo "$HOME/.cursor/bin" >> $GITHUB_PATH

      - name: Configure git identity
        run: |
          git config user.name "Cursor Agent"
          git config user.email "cursoragent@cursor.com"

      - name: Propose i18n updates
        env:
          CURSOR_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.CURSOR_API_KEY }}
          MODEL: gpt-5
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          BRANCH_PREFIX: translate
        run: |
          cursor-agent -p "You are operating in a GitHub Actions runner.

          The GitHub CLI is available as `gh` and authenticated via `GH_TOKEN`. Git is available. You have write access to repository contents and can comment on pull requests, but you must not create or edit PRs directly.

          # Context:
          - Repo: ${{ github.repository }}
          - PR Number: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
          - Head Ref: ${{ github.head_ref }}
          - Translate Branch Prefix: ${{ env.BRANCH_PREFIX }}

          # Goal:
          - Detect i18n keys added or changed in the PR and fill only missing locales in message files. Never overwrite existing translations.

          # Requirements:
          1) Determine changed keys by inspecting the PR diff (source files and messages files).
          2) Compute missing keys per locale using the source/canonical locale as truth.
          3) Add entries only for missing keys. Preserve all existing values untouched.
          4) Validate JSON formatting and schemas.
          5) Maintain a persistent translate branch for this PR head using the Translate Branch Prefix from Context. Create it if missing, update it otherwise, and push changes to origin.
          6) Post or update a single PR comment on the original PR written in natural language (1–2 sentences) that briefly explains what was updated and why, and includes an inline compare link to quick-create a PR.
          7) Avoid duplicate comments; update a previous bot comment if present.
          8) If no changes are necessary, make no commits and post no comment.

          # Inputs and conventions:
          - Use `gh pr diff` and git history to detect changes.

          # Deliverables when updates occur:
          - Pushed commits to the persistent translate branch for this PR head.
          - A single natural-language PR comment on the original PR with the compare link above.
          " --force --model "$MODEL" --output-format=text

# Configuration

Configure the Agent CLI using the `cli-config.json` file.

## [File location](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/reference/configuration\#file-location)

| Type | Platform | Path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Global | macOS/Linux | `~/.cursor/cli-config.json` |
| Global | Windows | `$env:USERPROFILE\.cursor\cli-config.json` |
| Project | All | `<project>/.cursor/cli.json` |

Only permissions can be configured at the project level. All other CLI
settings must be set globally.

Override with environment variables:

- **`CURSOR_CONFIG_DIR`**: custom directory path
- **`XDG_CONFIG_HOME`** (Linux/BSD): uses `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cursor/cli-config.json`

## [Schema](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/reference/configuration\#schema)

### [Required fields](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/reference/configuration\#required-fields)

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `version` | number | Config schema version (current: `1`) |
| `editor.vimMode` | boolean | Enable Vim keybindings (default: `false`) |
| `permissions.allow` | string\[\] | Permitted operations (see [Permissions](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/reference/permissions)) |
| `permissions.deny` | string\[\] | Forbidden operations (see [Permissions](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/reference/permissions)) |

### [Optional fields](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/reference/configuration\#optional-fields)

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `model` | object | Selected model configuration |
| `hasChangedDefaultModel` | boolean | CLI-managed model override flag |

## [Examples](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/reference/configuration\#examples)

### [Minimal config](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/reference/configuration\#minimal-config)

```
{
  "version": 1,
  "editor": { "vimMode": false },
  "permissions": { "allow": ["Shell(ls)"], "deny": [] }
}
```

### [Enable Vim mode](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/reference/configuration\#enable-vim-mode)

```
{
  "version": 1,
  "editor": { "vimMode": true },
  "permissions": { "allow": ["Shell(ls)"], "deny": [] }
}
```

### [Configure permissions](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/reference/configuration\#configure-permissions)

```
{
  "version": 1,
  "editor": { "vimMode": false },
  "permissions": {
    "allow": ["Shell(ls)", "Shell(echo)"],
    "deny": ["Shell(rm)"]
  }
}
```

See [Permissions](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/reference/permissions) for available permission types and examples.

## [Troubleshooting](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/reference/configuration\#troubleshooting)

**Config errors**: Move the file aside and restart:

```
mv ~/.cursor/cli-config.json ~/.cursor/cli-config.json.bad
```

**Changes don't persist**: Ensure valid JSON and write permissions. Some fields are CLI-managed and may be overwritten.

## [Notes](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/reference/configuration\#notes)

- Pure JSON format (no comments)
- CLI performs self-repair for missing fields
- Corrupted files are backed up as `.bad` and recreated
- Permission entries are exact strings (see [Permissions](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/reference/permissions) for details)

## [Models](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/reference/configuration\#models)

You can select a model for the CLI using the `/model` slash command.

```
/model auto
/model gpt-5
/model sonnet-4
```

# Memories

Memories are automatically generated rules based on your conversations in Chat. These memories are scoped to your project and maintain context across sessions.

## [How memories are created](https://cursor.com/docs/context/memories\#how-memories-are-created)

1. **Sidecar observation**: Cursor uses a sidecar approach where another model observes your conversations and automatically extracts relevant memories. This happens passively in the background as you work. Background-generated memories require user approval before being saved, ensuring trust and control over what gets remembered.

2. **Tool calls**: Agent can directly create memories using tool calls when you explicitly ask it to remember something or when it notices important information that should be preserved for future sessions.


## [Manage memories](https://cursor.com/docs/context/memories\#manage-memories)

You can manage memories from Cursor Settings → Rules.

# Code Review with Cursor CLI

This tutorial shows you how to set up code review using Cursor CLI in GitHub Actions. The workflow will analyze pull requests, identify issues, and post feedback as comments.

For most users, we recommend using [Bugbot](https://cursor.com/docs/bugbot) instead. Bugbot
provides managed automated code review with no setup required. This CLI
approach is useful to explore capabilities and for advanced customization.

### Example: Full workflow file

![Automated code review in action showing inline comments on a pull request](https://cursor.com/docs-static/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs-static%2Fimages%2Fcli%2Fcookbook%2Fcode-review%2Fcomment.png&w=1920&q=75)

## [Configure authentication](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/cookbook/code-review\#configure-authentication)

[Set up your API key and repository secrets](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/github-actions#authentication) to authenticate Cursor CLI in GitHub Actions.

## [Set up agent permissions](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/cookbook/code-review\#set-up-agent-permissions)

Create a configuration file to control what actions the agent can perform. This prevents unintended operations like pushing code or creating pull requests.

Create `.cursor/cli.json` in your repository root:

```
{
  "permissions": {
    "deny": [\
      "Shell(git push)",\
      "Shell(gh pr create)",\
      "Write(**)"\
    ]
  }
}
```

This configuration allows the agent to read files and use the GitHub CLI for comments, but prevents it from making changes to your repository. See the [permissions reference](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/reference/permissions) for more configuration options.

## [Build the GitHub Actions workflow](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/cookbook/code-review\#build-the-github-actions-workflow)

Now let's build the workflow step by step.

### [Set up the workflow trigger](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/cookbook/code-review\#set-up-the-workflow-trigger)

Create `.github/workflows/cursor-code-review.yml` and configure it to run on pull requests:

```
name: Cursor Code Review

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, ready_for_review]

jobs:
  code-review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write

    steps:
```

### [Checkout the repository](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/cookbook/code-review\#checkout-the-repository)

Add the checkout step to access the pull request code:

```
- name: Checkout repository
  uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    fetch-depth: 0
    ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}
```

### [Install Cursor CLI](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/cookbook/code-review\#install-cursor-cli)

Add the CLI installation step:

```
- name: Install Cursor CLI
  run: |
    curl https://cursor.com/install -fsS | bash
    echo "$HOME/.cursor/bin" >> $GITHUB_PATH
```

### [Configure the review agent](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/cookbook/code-review\#configure-the-review-agent)

Before implementing the full review step, let's understand the anatomy of our review prompt. This section outlines how we want the agent to behave:

**Objective**:
We want the agent to review the current PR diff and flag only clear, high-severity issues, then leave very short inline comments (1-2 sentences) on changed lines only with a brief summary at the end. This keeps the signal-to-noise ratio balanced.

**Format**:
We want comments that are short and to the point. We use emojis to make scanning comments easier, and we want a high-level summary of the full review at the end.

**Submission**:
When the review is done, we want the agent to include a short comment based on what was found during the review. The agent should submit one review containing inline comments plus a concise summary.

**Edge cases**:
We need to handle: - Existing comments being resolved: The agent should mark them as done when addressed - Avoid duplicates: The agent should skip commenting if similar feedback already exists on or near the same lines

**Final prompt**:
The complete prompt combines all these behavioral requirements to create focused, actionable feedback

Now let's implement the review agent step:

```
- name: Perform code review
  env:
    CURSOR_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.CURSOR_API_KEY }}
    GH_TOKEN: ${{ github.token }}
  run: |
    cursor-agent --force --model "$MODEL" --output-format=text --print "You are operating in a GitHub Actions runner performing automated code review. The gh CLI is available and authenticated via GH_TOKEN. You may comment on pull requests.

    Context:
    - Repo: ${{ github.repository }}
    - PR Number: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
    - PR Head SHA: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}
    - PR Base SHA: ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.sha }}

    Objectives:
    1) Re-check existing review comments and reply resolved when addressed
    2) Review the current PR diff and flag only clear, high-severity issues
    3) Leave very short inline comments (1-2 sentences) on changed lines only and a brief summary at the end

    Procedure:
    - Get existing comments: gh pr view --json comments
    - Get diff: gh pr diff
    - If a previously reported issue appears fixed by nearby changes, reply: ✅ This issue appears to be resolved by the recent changes
    - Avoid duplicates: skip if similar feedback already exists on or near the same lines

    Commenting rules:
    - Max 10 inline comments total; prioritize the most critical issues
    - One issue per comment; place on the exact changed line
    - Natural tone, specific and actionable; do not mention automated or high-confidence
    - Use emojis: 🚨 Critical 🔒 Security ⚡ Performance ⚠️ Logic ✅ Resolved ✨ Improvement

    Submission:
    - Submit one review containing inline comments plus a concise summary
    - Use only: gh pr review --comment
    - Do not use: gh pr review --approve or --request-changes"
```

```

## [Test your reviewer](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/cookbook/code-review\#test-your-reviewer)

Create a test pull request to verify the workflow works and the agent posts review comments with emoji feedback.

![Pull request showing automated review comments with emojis and inline feedback on specific lines](https://cursor.com/docs-static/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs-static%2Fimages%2Fcli%2Fcookbook%2Fcode-review%2Fgithub-actions.png&w=1920&q=75)

## [Next steps](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/cookbook/code-review\#next-steps)

You now have a working automated code review system. Consider these enhancements:

- Set up additional workflows for [fixing CI failures](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/cookbook/fix-ci)
- Configure different review levels for different branches
- Integrate with your team's existing code review process
- Customize the agent's behavior for different file types or directories

# Network Configuration

Cursor needs to communicate with backend services and AI providers. This documentation covers how to configure Cursor to work within your network infrastructure, including proxies, firewalls, and encryption requirements.

## [Proxy configuration](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/network-configuration\#proxy-configuration)

Many enterprises route traffic through proxy servers for monitoring and security. Cursor works with most proxy configurations, but some proxy settings can cause issues with streaming responses.

### [HTTP/2 vs HTTP/1.1](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/network-configuration\#http2-vs-http11)

Cursor uses HTTP/2 bidirectional streaming by default for real-time chat and agent experiences. Some enterprise proxies don't support HTTP/2 streaming correctly. Zscaler is the most widely used proxy with this limitation.

If you experience issues with streaming, Cursor automatically falls back to HTTP/1.1 Server-Side Events (SSE) mode. This fallback was specifically designed to work with Zscaler and similar proxies that buffer or break HTTP/2 streams. The fallback happens transparently when HTTP/2 bidirectional streaming doesn't work.

### [SSL inspection and DLP](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/network-configuration\#ssl-inspection-and-dlp)

Many corporate proxies perform SSL man-in-the-middle inspection to scan traffic for security threats or data loss prevention (DLP). This replaces Cursor's SSL certificates with your proxy's certificates.

When Cursor traffic goes through Secure Web Gateways (SWG), SSL inspection, or DLP, it often causes timeouts, slowness, or errors when using Cursor's Agent capabilities. This is one of the most common deployment blockers for enterprise customers.

Cursor's services are already encrypted end-to-end. We recommend disabling SSL inspection for these domains:

- `.cursor.sh`
- `cursor-cdn.com`
- `marketplace.cursorapi.com`
- `authenticate.cursor.sh`
- `authenticator.cursor.sh`

If your security policy requires SSL inspection on all traffic, your proxy must support:

- HTTP/2 bidirectional streaming (or that Cursor's HTTP/1.1 fallback works)
- Server-Sent Events (SSE) passthrough without buffering
- Long-running connections without forced timeouts
- Disabling response buffering for streaming content types

### [Testing proxy connectivity](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/network-configuration\#testing-proxy-connectivity)

If you experience connection issues, you can test connectivity manually using curl commands. These commands simulate the requests Cursor makes to backend services.

**Test basic connectivity:**

```
curl -v https://api2.cursor.sh |& grep -C1 issuer:
```

This shows which SSL certificate is in use. You should see Amazon RSA. If you see your proxy provider (like Zscaler), SSL inspection is active.

**Test HTTP/1.1 streaming:**

```
echo -ne "\x0\x0\x0\x0\x11{\"payload\":\"foo\"}" | \
  curl --http1.1 -No - -XPOST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/connect+json" \
  --data-binary @- \
  https://api2.cursor.sh/aiserver.v1.HealthService/StreamSSE
```

You should see output appear line by line over 5 seconds. If it appears all at once after 5 seconds, your proxy is buffering streaming responses.

**Test HTTP/2 bidirectional streaming:**

```
(for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do \
  echo -ne "\x0\x0\x0\x0\x12{\"payload\":\"foo$i\"}"; \
  sleep 1; \
done) | curl -No - -XPOST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/connect+json" \
  -T - \
  https://api2.cursor.sh/aiserver.v1.HealthService/StreamBidi
```

Output should appear once per second. If buffered for 5 seconds, your proxy doesn't support HTTP/2 bidirectional streaming.

## [IP allowlisting](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/network-configuration\#ip-allowlisting)

If your network uses IP-based access controls, you need to allow traffic to Cursor's backend services.

Rather than maintaining IP address lists (which can change), configure your firewall to allow traffic to these domain patterns:

- `*.cursor.sh`
- `*.cursor-cdn.com`
- `*.cursorapi.com`

If you must use IP addresses, contact your account team for the current IP ranges. Note that these ranges may change as we scale infrastructure.

## [VPC peering](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/network-configuration\#vpc-peering)

Cursor doesn't currently offer VPC peering or private connectivity options.

However, when you run Cursor agents (either in the IDE or via the CLI), they inherit your existing network configuration. If you run Cursor on a machine within your VPC, agent operations inherit:

- Your network security groups
- Your firewall rules
- Your DNS configuration
- Your VPN or private network access

This means Cursor agents can access internal resources that the machine can reach, while following your existing network security controls.

## [Encryption](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/network-configuration\#encryption)

Cursor encrypts data both in transit and at rest.

### [In transit](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/network-configuration\#in-transit)

- TLS 1.2 or higher for all connections to Cursor services
- TLS for connections to third-party AI providers
- Certificate pinning for critical services

### [At rest](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/network-configuration\#at-rest)

- AES-256 encryption for stored data
- Encrypted vector database storage
- Encrypted code storage for Background Agents (when enabled)

### [Key management](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/network-configuration\#key-management)

Cursor manages encryption keys. Keys are rotated according to security best practices and stored in secure key management systems.

For enhanced security control, enterprise customers can use Customer Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) for encrypting data stored in Cursor's infrastructure. See [Data Encryption](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/privacy-and-data-governance#data-encryption) for details.

## [LLM gateways](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/network-configuration\#llm-gateways)

Some enterprises want to route LLM traffic through their own gateways for additional monitoring and control.

Custom gateways can introduce additional latency, rate limiting, and compatibility issues. We instead recommend using Cursor's built-in hooks feature to implement your own security controls.

Cursor's [Zero Data Retention policy](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/dashboard#privacy-settings) does not apply when using your own API keys. Your data handling will be subject to the privacy policies of your chosen AI provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Azure, or AWS).

See [Hooks](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/hooks) and [Security Guardrails](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/llm-safety-and-controls) for details.

## [Background Agents networking](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/network-configuration\#background-agents-networking)

Background Agents run on Cursor's infrastructure, not your local network. They can access:

- Public GitHub repositories
- GitHub Enterprise Cloud repositories you've granted access to
- GitHub Enterprise Server (self-hosted GitHub Enterprise)
- On-prem + cloud-based GitLab and Bitbucket
- Public package registries (npm, PyPI, etc.)

Background Agents cannot access:

- Resources behind your corporate firewall
- On-premises GitHub Enterprise Server
- Private package registries without internet access

If your development workflow requires access to internal resources, use the Cursor IDE on machines within your network instead of Background Agents.

## [Troubleshooting checklist](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/network-configuration\#troubleshooting-checklist)

If you experience connection issues:

1. **Test basic connectivity** to `api2.cursor.sh`
2. **Check if SSL inspection is active** and consider excluding Cursor domains
3. **Verify streaming works** using the curl tests above
4. **Check firewall rules** allow traffic to `*.cursor.sh` and related domains
5. **Review proxy logs** for connection errors or timeouts
6. **Test from a machine outside your network** to isolate network-specific issues

Most connectivity issues stem from proxies buffering streaming responses. Work with your network team to disable buffering for Cursor domains or implement proper streaming support.

# Linear

Use [Background Agents](https://cursor.com/docs/background-agent) directly from Linear by delegating issues to Cursor or mentioning `@Cursor` in comments.

## [Get started](https://cursor.com/docs/integrations/linear\#get-started)

### [Installation](https://cursor.com/docs/integrations/linear\#installation)

You must be a Cursor admin to connect the Linear integration. Other team
settings are available to non-admin members.

1. Go to [Cursor integrations](https://www.cursor.com/dashboard?tab=integrations)
2. Click _Connect_ next to Linear
3. Connect your Linear workspace and select team
4. Click _Authorize_
5. Complete any remaining Background Agent setup in Cursor:
   - Connect GitHub and select default repository
   - Enable usage-based pricing
   - Confirm privacy settings

### [Account linking](https://cursor.com/docs/integrations/linear\#account-linking)

First use prompts account linking between Cursor and Linear. GitHub connection required for PR creation.

## [How to use](https://cursor.com/docs/integrations/linear\#how-to-use)

Delegate issues to Cursor or mention `@Cursor` in comments. Cursor analyzes issues and filters out non-development work automatically.

### [Delegating issues](https://cursor.com/docs/integrations/linear\#delegating-issues)

1. Open Linear issue
2. Click assignee field
3. Select "Cursor"

![Delegating an issue to Cursor in Linear](https://cursor.com/docs-static/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs-static%2Fimages%2Fintegrations%2Flinear%2Flinear-delegate.png&w=1920&q=75)

### [Mentioning Cursor](https://cursor.com/docs/integrations/linear\#mentioning-cursor)

Mention `@Cursor` in a comment to assign a new agent or provide additional instructions, for example: `@Cursor fix the authentication bug described above`.

## [Workflow](https://cursor.com/docs/integrations/linear\#workflow)

Background Agents show real-time status in Linear and create PRs automatically when complete. Track progress in [Cursor dashboard](https://www.cursor.com/dashboard?tab=background-agents).

![Background Agent status updates in Linear](https://cursor.com/docs-static/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs-static%2Fimages%2Fintegrations%2Flinear%2Flinear-activity.png&w=1920&q=75)

### [Follow-up instructions](https://cursor.com/docs/integrations/linear\#follow-up-instructions)

You can respond in the agent session and it'll get sent as a follow-up to the agent. Simply mention `@Cursor` in a Linear comment to provide additional guidance to a running Background Agent.

## [Configuration](https://cursor.com/docs/integrations/linear\#configuration)

Configure Background Agent settings from [Dashboard → Background Agents](https://www.cursor.com/dashboard?tab=background-agents).

| Setting | Location | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Default Repository** | Cursor Dashboard | Primary repository when no project repository configured |
| **Default Model** | Cursor Dashboard | AI model for Background Agents |
| **Base Branch** | Cursor Dashboard | Branch to create PRs from (typically `main` or `develop`) |

### [Configuration options](https://cursor.com/docs/integrations/linear\#configuration-options)

You can configure Background Agent behavior using several methods:

**Issue description or comments**: Use `[key=value]` syntax, for example:

- `@cursor please fix [repo=anysphere/everysphere]`
- `@cursor implement feature [model=claude-3.5-sonnet] [branch=feature-branch]`

**Issue labels**: Use parent-child label structure where the parent label is the configuration key and the child label is the value.

**Project labels**: Same parent-child structure as issue labels, applied at the project level.

Supported configuration keys:

- `repo`: Specify target repository (e.g., `owner/repository`)
- `branch`: Specify base branch for PR creation
- `model`: Specify AI model to use

### [Repository selection](https://cursor.com/docs/integrations/linear\#repository-selection)

Cursor determines which repository to work on using this priority order:

1. **Issue description/comments**: `[repo=owner/repository]` syntax in issue text or comments
2. **Issue labels**: Repository labels attached to the specific Linear issue
3. **Project labels**: Repository labels attached to the Linear project
4. **Default repository**: Repository specified in Cursor dashboard settings

#### [Setting up repository labels](https://cursor.com/docs/integrations/linear\#setting-up-repository-labels)

To create repository labels in Linear:

1. Go to **Settings** in your Linear workspace
2. Click **Labels**
3. Click **New group**
4. Name the group "repo" (case insensitive - must be exactly "repo", not "Repository" or other variations)
5. Within that group, create labels for each repository using the format `owner/repo`

These labels can then be assigned to issues or projects to specify which repository the Background Agent should work on.

![Configuring repository labels in Linear](https://cursor.com/docs-static/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs-static%2Fimages%2Fintegrations%2Flinear%2Flinear-project-labels.png&w=1920&q=75)

## [Advanced features](https://cursor.com/docs/integrations/linear\#advanced-features)

### [Triage rules (Advanced)](https://cursor.com/docs/integrations/linear\#triage-rules-advanced)

Set up automation rules in Linear to automatically delegate issues to Cursor:

1. Go to Linear project settings
2. Navigate to triage rules
3. Create rules that automatically:
   - Add specific labels
   - Assign issues to Cursor
   - Trigger Background Agents based on conditions

Triage rules are an advanced feature with some current limitations. Linear
requires a human assignee for rules to fire, though this requirement may be
removed in future updates.

### [Getting help](https://cursor.com/docs/integrations/linear\#getting-help)

Check [agent activity](https://www.cursor.com/dashboard?tab=background-agents) and include request IDs when contacting support.

## [Feedback](https://cursor.com/docs/integrations/linear\#feedback)

Share feedback through Linear comments or your Cursor dashboard support channels.

# Analytics v2

We are working on a v2 release of our analytics infrastructure. This includes a refactor of the way in which we track various metrics.

As of **September 1, 2025**, and for users on **Cursor version 1.5**, analytics will utilize our V2 infrastructure. Prior versions would have undercounted various metrics, including:

- Total Accepted Lines of Code
- Total Suggested Lines of Code
- Total Tabs Accepted

Please stay tuned as we continue to invest in analytics and release new features in this space.

Automatic snapshots track Agent's changes. Restore previous states if
changes don't work as expected or to try different approaches.

[**Todos**](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/planning)

Agent creates and manages structured task lists for complex projects. Use
todos as a planning document to break down work into manageable steps
and track progress.

[**Hooks**](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/hooks)

Extend Agent capabilities with custom hooks. Create reusable functions
that integrate with your workflow and automate repetitive tasks.

[**Parallel**](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/chat/tabs)

Run multiple conversations simultaneously with `Cmd+T`. Each tab
maintains its own context, history, and model selection.

[**Terminal**](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/terminal)

Agent executes terminal commands, monitors output, and handles multi-step
processes. Configure auto-run for trusted workflows or require
confirmation for safety.

[**Diffs**](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/review)

Examine changes before accepting them. Review interface shows additions
and deletions with color-coded lines for control over modifications.

[**Autocomplete**](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/autocomplete)

# Fix CI Failures with Cursor CLI

Fix CI failures using Cursor CLI in GitHub Actions. This workflow analyzes failures, makes targeted fixes, and creates a fix branch with a quick-create PR link.

This workflow monitors a specific workflow by name. Update the `workflows` list to match your actual CI workflow name.

**Example: `.github/workflows/fix-ci.yml`**

```
name: Fix CI Failures

on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: [Test]
    types: [completed]

permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write
  actions: read

jobs:
  attempt-fix:
    if: >-
      ${{ github.event.workflow_run.conclusion == 'failure' && github.event.workflow_run.name != 'Fix CI Failures' }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Install Cursor CLI
        run: |
          curl https://cursor.com/install -fsS | bash
          echo "$HOME/.cursor/bin" >> $GITHUB_PATH

      - name: Configure git identity
        run: |
          git config user.name "Cursor Agent"
          git config user.email "cursoragent@cursor.com"

      - name: Fix CI failure
        env:
          CURSOR_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.CURSOR_API_KEY }}
          MODEL: gpt-5
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          BRANCH_PREFIX: ci-fix
        run: |
          cursor-agent -p "You are operating in a GitHub Actions runner.

          The GitHub CLI is available as `gh` and authenticated via `GH_TOKEN`. Git is available. You have write access to repository contents and can comment on pull requests, but you must not create or edit PRs directly.

          # Context:
          - Repo: ${{ github.repository }}
          - Owner: ${{ github.repository_owner }}
          - Workflow Run ID: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.id }}
          - Workflow Run URL: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.html_url }}
          - Fix Branch Prefix: ${{ env.BRANCH_PREFIX }}

          # Goal:
          - Implement an end-to-end CI fix flow driven by the failing PR, creating a separate persistent fix branch and proposing a quick-create PR back into the original PR's branch.

          # Requirements:
          1) Identify the PR associated with the failed workflow run and determine its base and head branches. Let HEAD_REF be the PR's head branch (the contributor/origin branch).
          2) Maintain a persistent fix branch for this PR head using the Fix Branch Prefix from Context. Create it if missing, update it otherwise, and push changes to origin.
          3) Attempt to resolve the CI failure by making minimal, targeted edits consistent with the repo's style. Keep changes scoped and safe.
          4) You do NOT have permission to create PRs. Instead, post or update a single natural-language PR comment (1–2 sentences) that briefly explains the CI fix and includes an inline compare link to quick-create a PR.

          # Inputs and conventions:
          - Use `gh api`, `gh run view`, `gh pr view`, `gh pr diff`, `gh pr list`, `gh run download`, and git commands as needed to discover the failing PR and branches.
          - Avoid duplicate comments; if a previous bot comment exists, update it instead of posting a new one.
          - If no actionable fix is possible, make no changes and post no comment.

          # Deliverables when updates occur:
          - Pushed commits to the persistent fix branch for this PR head.
          - A single natural-language PR comment on the original PR that includes the inline compare link above.

Configuration

# Java

This guide will help you configure Cursor for Java development, including setting up the JDK, installing necessary extensions, debugging, running Java applications, and integrating build tools like Maven and Gradle. It also covers workflow features similar to IntelliJ or VS Code.

## [Setting up Java for Cursor](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/languages/java\#setting-up-java-for-cursor)

### [Java Installation](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/languages/java\#java-installation)

Before setting up Cursor itself, you will need Java installed on your machine.

Cursor does not ship with a Java compiler, so you need to install a JDK if you
haven't already.

- **Windows**: Download and install a JDK (e.g., OpenJDK, Oracle JDK, Microsoft Build of OpenJDK). Set JAVA\_HOME and add JAVA\_HOME\\bin to your PATH.
- **macOS**: Install via Homebrew ( `brew install openjdk`) or download an installer. Ensure JAVA\_HOME points to the installed JDK.
- **Linux**: Use your package manager ( `sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk` or equivalent) or install via SDKMAN.

To check installation, run:

```
java -version
javac -version
```

If Cursor does not detect your JDK, configure it manually in settings.json. Then, restart Cursor to apply changes.

```
{
  "java.jdt.ls.java.home": "/path/to/jdk",
  "java.configuration.runtimes": [\
    {\
      "name": "JavaSE-17",\
      "path": "/path/to/jdk-17",\
      "default": true\
    }\
  ]
}
```

### [Cursor Setup](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/languages/java\#cursor-setup)

Cursor supports VS Code extensions. Install the following manually:

[Extension Pack for Java\\
\\
Includes Java language support, debugger, test runner, Maven support, and\\
project manager](cursor:extension/vscjava.vscode-java-pack) [Gradle for Java\\
\\
Essential for working with Gradle build system](cursor:extension/vscjava.vscode-gradle) [Spring Boot Extension Pack\\
\\
Required for Spring Boot development](cursor:extension/vmware.vscode-boot-dev-pack) [Kotlin\\
\\
Necessary for Kotlin application development](cursor:extension/fwcd.kotlin)

### [Configure Build Tools](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/languages/java\#configure-build-tools)

#### [Maven](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/languages/java\#maven)

Ensure Maven is installed ( `mvn -version`). Install from [maven.apache.org](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) if needed:

1. Download the binary archive
2. Extract to desired location
3. Set MAVEN\_HOME environment variable to the extracted folder
4. Add %MAVEN\_HOME%\\bin (Windows) or $MAVEN\_HOME/bin (Unix) to PATH

#### [Gradle](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/languages/java\#gradle)

Ensure Gradle is installed ( `gradle -version`). Install from [gradle.org](https://gradle.org/install/) if needed:

1. Download the binary distribution
2. Extract to desired location
3. Set GRADLE\_HOME environment variable to the extracted folder
4. Add %GRADLE\_HOME%\\bin (Windows) or $GRADLE\_HOME/bin (Unix) to PATH

Alternatively, use the Gradle Wrapper which will automatically download and use the correct Gradle version:

## [Running and Debugging](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/languages/java\#running-and-debugging)

Now you are all set up, it's time to run and debug your Java code.
Depending on your needs, you can use the following methods:

Run

Click the "Run" link that appears above any main method to quickly execute
your program

Debug

Open the Run and Debug sidebar panel and use the Run button to start your
application

Terminal

Execute from command line using Maven or Gradlecommands

Spring Boot

Launch Spring Boot applications directly from the Spring Boot Dashboard
extension

## [Java x Cursor Workflow](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/languages/java\#java-x-cursor-workflow)

Cursor's AI-powered features can significantly enhance your Java development workflow. Here are some ways to leverage Cursor's capabilities specifically for Java:

Tab Completion

Smart completions for methods, signatures, and Java boilerplate like
getters/setters.

Agent Mode

Implement design patterns, refactor code, or generate classes with proper
inheritance.

Inline Edit

Quick inline edits to methods, fix errors, or generate unit tests without
breaking flow.

Chat

Get help with Java concepts, debug exceptions, or understand framework
features.

### [Example Workflows](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/languages/java\#example-workflows)

1. **Generate Java Boilerplate**: Use [Tab completion](https://cursor.com/docs/tab/overview) to quickly generate constructors, getters/setters, equals/hashCode methods, and other repetitive Java patterns.
2. **Debug Complex Java Exceptions**: When facing a cryptic Java stack trace, highlight it and use [Ask](https://cursor.com/docs/chat/overview) to explain the root cause and suggest potential fixes.
3. **Refactor Legacy Java Code**: Use [Agent mode](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/overview) to modernize older Java code - convert anonymous classes to lambdas, upgrade to newer Java language features, or implement design patterns.
4. **Frameworks Development**: Add your documentation to Cursor's context with @docs, and generate framework-specific code throughout Cursor.

          3) Maintain the persistent docs branch for this PR head using the Docs Branch Prefix from Context. Create it if missing, update it otherwise, and push changes to origin.
          4) You do NOT have permission to create PRs. Instead, post or update a single natural-language PR comment (1–2 sentences) that briefly explains the docs updates and includes an inline compare link to quick-create a PR

          # Inputs and conventions:
          - Use `gh pr diff` and git history to detect changes and derive incremental ranges since the last docs update.
          - Do not attempt to create or edit PRs directly. Use the compare link format above.
          - Keep changes minimal and consistent with repo style. If no doc updates are necessary, make no changes and post no comment.

          # Deliverables when updates occur:
          - Pushed commits to the persistent docs branch for this PR head.

GET `/v0/me`

Retrieve information about the API key being used for authentication.

```
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.cursor.com/v0/me \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'
```

### [List Models](https://cursor.com/docs/background-agent/api/endpoints\#list-models)

GET `/v0/models`

If you want to provide the background agent's model during creation, you can use this endpoint to see a list of recommended models.

In that case, we also recommend having an "Auto" option, in which you would not provide a model name to the creation endpoint,
and we will pick the most appropriate model.

```
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.cursor.com/v0/models \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'
```

### [List GitHub Repositories](https://cursor.com/docs/background-agent/api/endpoints\#list-github-repositories)

GET `/v0/repositories`

Retrieve a list of GitHub repositories accessible to the authenticated user.

```
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.cursor.com/v0/repositories \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'
```

**This endpoint has very strict rate limits.**

Limit requests to **1 / user / minute**, and **30 / user / hour.**

This request can take tens of seconds to respond for users with access to many repositories.

Make sure to handle this information not being available gracefully.

## [Response Codes](https://cursor.com/docs/background-agent/api/endpoints\#response-codes)

All endpoints return standard HTTP status codes:

- `200` \- Success (for GET requests)
- `201` \- Created (for POST requests that create resources)
- `400` \- Bad Request (invalid parameters)
- `401` \- Unauthorized (invalid or missing API key)
- `403` \- Forbidden (insufficient permissions, plan limits exceeded)
- `404` \- Not Found
- `409` \- Conflict (resource in invalid state)
- `429` \- Rate Limit Exceeded
- `500` \- Internal Server Error

## [Rate Limiting](https://cursor.com/docs/background-agent/api/endpoints\#rate-limiting)

The API implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage. When you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive a `429` status code. We recommend implementing exponential backoff in your applications.

## [Authentication](https://cursor.com/docs/background-agent/api/endpoints\#authentication)

All endpoints require authentication via Bearer token. Include your API key in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

You can obtain an API key from your [Cursor Dashboard](https://cursor.com/settings).

# Max Mode

Normally, Cursor uses a context window of 200k tokens (~16,000 lines of code). Max Mode is our option to turn on the maximum context windows for all models. This will be slower and more expensive. It is most relevant for Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT 4.1, which have 1M token context windows.

# LLM Safety and Controls

AI models can behave unexpectedly. This documentation covers how to control what agents can do, set up safety guardrails, and guide LLM behavior toward desired outcomes.

## [Understanding model behavior](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/llm-safety-and-controls\#understanding-model-behavior)

LLMs generate text based on probability distributions, not by retrieving facts from a database or executing deterministic logic. They can produce different outputs for the same input, hallucinate facts or code that seems plausible but is wrong, and be influenced by carefully crafted prompts (prompt injection).

You can't rely on LLMs to always make safe decisions. Instead, you combine two approaches: **security controls** that enforce hard boundaries on what agents can do, and **steering mechanisms** that guide LLM behavior toward better outcomes.

For a deeper understanding of how LLMs work, see [How AI Models Work](https://cursor.com/learn/how-ai-models-work).

## [Two approaches to safety](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/llm-safety-and-controls\#two-approaches-to-safety)

Cursor provides two complementary approaches to managing AI agent behavior:

**Security controls (deterministic enforcement)**: Hard boundaries that block dangerous operations regardless of what the LLM suggests. These include terminal command restrictions, enforcement hooks that reject operations, approval workflows, and sandboxing. Security controls are your primary defense against harmful agent actions.

**LLM steering (non-deterministic guidance)**: Mechanisms that guide the LLM toward better behavior by shaping its context and available actions. These include Rules that add instructions to prompts, Commands that provide reusable workflows, and integrations that enrich the agent's knowledge. Steering improves agent quality but doesn't guarantee prevention of harmful actions.

Use both approaches together. Security controls provide the safety net. Steering reduces how often agents attempt problematic actions in the first place.

## [Security controls](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/llm-safety-and-controls\#security-controls)

These deterministic controls enforce hard boundaries on what agents can do. They work regardless of what the LLM suggests.

### [Terminal command restrictions](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/llm-safety-and-controls\#terminal-command-restrictions)

By default, Cursor requires your approval before executing any terminal command. This protects against destructive commands (deleting files, dropping databases), commands that expose sensitive data, and commands with unintended side effects.

When an agent wants to run a command, you see a prompt showing the full command. You can approve and run it, deny it, or modify it before running.

#### [Auto-approval risks](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/llm-safety-and-controls\#auto-approval-risks)

You can enable auto-approval for terminal commands, but understand the risks. Agents might run destructive commands without your knowledge, commands execute before you can review them, and bugs or prompt injection could cause unintended operations.

#### [Auto-run configuration](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/llm-safety-and-controls\#auto-run-configuration)

Enterprise teams can configure auto-run policies in the team dashboard. You can create an allowlist of commands that don't require approval, such as `npm install`, `pip install`, `cargo build`, or `make test`.

The allowlist is best-effort, not a security boundary. Determined agents or prompt injection might bypass it. Always combine allowlists with other security controls like hooks.

See [Agent Security](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/security) for details on terminal command controls.

### [Enforcement hooks](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/llm-safety-and-controls\#enforcement-hooks)

Hooks let you run custom logic at key points in the agent loop.

- Before prompt submission: Scan prompts for sensitive data before they're sent to LLMs. Block submissions that contain API keys or credentials, personal identifiable information (PII), or proprietary information.
- Before file reading: Scan files before agents read them. Redact or block access to configuration files with secrets, PII in databases or logs, or proprietary algorithms.
- After code generation: Scan generated code before it's written to disk. Check for security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS), licensed code that might cause IP issues, or API keys and credentials in code.
- Before terminal execution: Block dangerous commands or route them through approval workflows. For example, block all `git push` commands, require approval for any `sudo` command, or block database `DROP` statements.

#### [Example: Blocking git commands](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/llm-safety-and-controls\#example-blocking-git-commands)

This hook intercepts shell commands and blocks raw git usage, directing users to the GitHub CLI instead:

```
#!/bin/bash
input=$(cat)
command=$(echo "$input" | jq -r '.command')

if [[ "$command" =~ git[[:space:]] ]]; then
    cat << EOF
{
  "permission": "deny",
  "userMessage": "Git command blocked. Please use gh tool instead.",
  "agentMessage": "Use 'gh' commands instead of raw git."
}
EOF
fi
```

#### [Example: Redacting secrets](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/llm-safety-and-controls\#example-redacting-secrets)

This hook scans file contents for GitHub API keys and blocks access if found:

```
#!/bin/bash
input=$(cat)
content=$(echo "$input" | jq -r '.content')

if echo "$content" | grep -qE 'gh[ps]_[A-Za-z0-9]{36}'; then
    cat << EOF
{
  "permission": "deny"
}
EOF
    exit 3
fi
```

See [Hooks](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/hooks) for complete documentation and more examples.

### [Protecting sensitive files](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/llm-safety-and-controls\#protecting-sensitive-files)

Not all files in your repositories should be accessible to AI. Configuration files, secrets, and sensitive data need protection.

#### [.cursorignore](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/llm-safety-and-controls\#cursorignore)

The `.cursorignore` file works like `.gitignore` but controls what Cursor can access. Files matching patterns in `.cursorignore` are excluded from:

- Codebase indexing
- Agent file reading
- Context selection
- Semantic search

`.cursorignore` is not a security boundary. It's a convenience feature to exclude files from AI processing, but:

- Users can manually read ignored files
- Agents might find ways to access ignored content
- It doesn't prevent file access, only excludes from indexing

For true security, use file system permissions or encrypt sensitive data.

See [Ignore Files](https://cursor.com/docs/context/ignore-files) for detailed syntax.

#### [.cursor directory protection](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/llm-safety-and-controls\#cursor-directory-protection)

The `.cursor` directory in repositories contains project-specific settings, rules, and cache files. Enterprise teams can prevent agents from modifying this directory.

When enabled, agents cannot:

- Modify files in `.cursor/`
- Delete the `.cursor/` directory
- Change cursor rules or settings files

Users can still manually edit these files, but agents require approval.

Configure in the [team dashboard](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/dashboard) under ".cursor Directory Protection" (Enterprise only).

### [Integration with DLP tools](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/llm-safety-and-controls\#integration-with-dlp-tools)

Many enterprises have existing Data Loss Prevention (DLP) tools that scan for sensitive data. You can integrate Cursor with your DLP tools in three ways.

#### [Endpoint DLP agents](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/llm-safety-and-controls\#endpoint-dlp-agents)

Most endpoint DLP software can inspect Cursor's network traffic. Configure your DLP to monitor traffic to `*.cursor.sh` domains, scan for sensitive patterns in outbound requests, and block or alert on policy violations.

Network DLP may impact performance. See [Network Configuration](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/network-configuration) for proxy considerations.

#### [Hooks-based DLP](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/llm-safety-and-controls\#hooks-based-dlp)

Use Cursor's hooks feature to implement custom DLP logic:

**Before prompt submission:**
Scan prompts for sensitive patterns before sending to LLMs:

```
#!/bin/bash
input=$(cat)
prompt=$(echo "$input" | jq -r '.prompt')

# Check for API keys
if echo "$prompt" | grep -qE 'api[_-]?key.*[A-Za-z0-9]{32}'; then
    cat << EOF
{
  "continue": false,
  "userMessage": "Prompt contains what looks like an API key. Remove it and try again."
}
EOF
    exit 1
fi

# Allow if no sensitive data found
cat << EOF
{
  "continue": true
}
EOF
```

**After code generation:**
Scan generated code before it's written to disk:

```
#!/bin/bash
input=$(cat)
file_path=$(echo "$input" | jq -r '.file_path')
edits=$(echo "$input" | jq -r '.edits[].new_string')

# Check for hardcoded credentials
if echo "$edits" | grep -qE 'password.*=.*["\047][^"\047]+["\047]'; then
    # Send to your DLP API for analysis
    curl -X POST "https://dlp.yourcompany.com/scan" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d "{\"content\":\"$edits\",\"file\":\"$file_path\"}"

    # Check API response and act accordingly
fi
```

#### [Third-party DLP integration](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/llm-safety-and-controls\#third-party-dlp-integration)

Call your existing DLP vendor's API from hooks:

```
#!/bin/bash
input=$(cat)
content=$(echo "$input" | jq -r '.content')

# Send to DLP API
response=$(curl -s -X POST "https://dlp-api.company.com/analyze" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $DLP_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"text\":\"$content\"}")

# Parse response
is_allowed=$(echo "$response" | jq -r '.allowed')

if [ "$is_allowed" = "true" ]; then
    cat << EOF
{
  "permission": "allow"
}
EOF
else
    violation=$(echo "$response" | jq -r '.violation_type')
    cat << EOF
{
  "permission": "deny",
  "userMessage": "Content blocked by DLP policy: $violation"
}
EOF
fi
```

This approach gives you centralized DLP policy management across all development tools.

### [Approval workflows](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/llm-safety-and-controls\#approval-workflows)

You can configure Cursor to ask for approval on every agent action. Users can set their agent to always ask before reading files, editing files, running terminal commands, or making network requests.

However, this approach significantly slows down the development experience. Agents need multiple actions to complete tasks, and requiring approval for each action makes the workflow tedious. Most teams instead choose to use hooks to block dangerous operations automatically.

### [Model provider safety](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/llm-safety-and-controls\#model-provider-safety)

All model providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, xAI) implement safety systems that filter harmful content. These systems reject prompts requesting harmful information, refuse to generate dangerous code, and filter outputs for safety.

Cursor works with providers to ensure models meet safety standards before deployment to users. Providers continuously evaluate models for safety issues. However, these are not security boundaries. Safety systems can be bypassed or tricked. Always implement your own controls through hooks and access policies.

### [Sandboxing considerations](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/llm-safety-and-controls\#sandboxing-considerations)

Cursor agents run on the same machine as your IDE. They can read files you can read, write files you can write, execute commands you can execute, and access network resources you can access.

There is no security boundary between agents and your user account. If your account can delete files, agents can delete files (with approval by default).

#### [Sandboxing options](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/llm-safety-and-controls\#sandboxing-options)

If you need stronger isolation, run Cursor in a separate VM using Background Agents, use file system permissions to limit what the Cursor process can access, or run Cursor on a dedicated development machine with limited access to production systems.

For most enterprises, the built-in approval requirements and hooks provide sufficient control.

### [File system permissions](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/llm-safety-and-controls\#file-system-permissions)

For further defense, use file system permissions to protect sensitive files:

**Restrict access to secret files:**

```
# Make secrets readable only by specific users
chmod 600 .env
chown app-user:app-user .env

# Or use separate directories with restricted access
chmod 700 /etc/app/secrets
```

**Separate sensitive repos:**
Keep highly sensitive code in separate repositories with restricted access. Don't clone these repositories to machines where Cursor runs.

**Encrypted filesystems:**
For very sensitive data, use encrypted filesystems that require explicit mounting. Don't mount these filesystems in directories where Cursor has access.

## [LLM steering](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/llm-safety-and-controls\#llm-steering)

Security controls block harmful actions after the LLM suggests them. Steering mechanisms guide the LLM to make better suggestions in the first place. These are non-deterministic. They improve outcomes but don't guarantee prevention.

### [Rules](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/llm-safety-and-controls\#rules)

Rules add instructions to the LLM's context window before every request. Use rules to establish coding standards, enforce architectural patterns, set security requirements, or define project-specific conventions.

Rules work at three scopes:

**User rules**: Apply to all projects for a specific user. Use these for personal preferences like code style or preferred libraries.

**Project rules**: Apply to everyone working on a project. Use these for project-specific standards like naming conventions or framework usage.

**Team rules**: Apply to all projects in your organization. Use these for company-wide standards like security requirements or compliance rules.

The LLM sees all applicable rules when generating responses. It will attempt to follow them, but rules are suggestions, not guarantees. Combine rules with enforcement hooks for requirements that must be followed.

See [Rules](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/rules) for configuration and examples.

### [Commands and workflows](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/llm-safety-and-controls\#commands-and-workflows)

Commands package reusable prompts that agents can invoke with slash commands like `/test` or `/deploy`. Commands help standardize common workflows across your team.

**Workflows**: Create multi-step processes that guide agents through complex tasks. For example, a `/security-review` command might instruct the agent to scan for SQL injection, check for exposed secrets, validate input sanitization, and generate a security report.

**Prompt libraries**: Build a collection of tested prompts for common tasks. This reduces variation in agent behavior and captures institutional knowledge.

Commands are scoped to teams, projects, or users. Team admins can create organization-wide commands that appear for all developers.

See [Commands](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/commands) for configuration and examples.

### [Context enrichment with MCPs](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/llm-safety-and-controls\#context-enrichment-with-mcps)

Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers let agents access external data sources. Use MCPs to pull in company documentation, query internal APIs, access knowledge bases, or integrate with development tools.

MCPs enrich the agent's context with information it wouldn't otherwise have. For example, an MCP might provide access to your API specifications, so agents can generate code that correctly calls your internal services.

MCPs are scoped to teams or users. Unlike hooks, MCPs don't enforce policies—they provide information that helps agents make better decisions.

See [MCP Integration](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/mcp) for configuration and examples.

When Agent generates code changes, they're presented in a review interface that shows additions and deletions with color-coded lines. This allows you to examine and control which changes are applied to your codebase.

The review interface displays code changes in a familiar diff format:

## [Diffs](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/review\#diffs)

| Type | Meaning | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Added lines** | New code additions | `+ const newVariable = 'hello';` |
| **Deleted lines** | Code removals | `- const oldVariable = 'goodbye';` |
| **Context lines** | Unchanged surrounding code | ` function example() ` |

## [Agent Review](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/review\#agent-review)

Agent Review runs Cursor Agent in a specialized mode focused on catching bugs in your diffs. This tool analyzes proposed changes line-by-line and flags issues before you merge.

> **Want automatic reviews on your PRs?**
>
> Check out [Bugbot](https://cursor.com/docs/bugbot), which applies advanced analysis to catch issues early and suggest improvements automatically on every pull request.

There are two ways to use Agent Review: In the agent diff and in the source control tab.

### [Agent diff](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/review\#agent-diff)

Review the output of an agent diff: after a response, click **Review changes**, then run Agent Review to analyze the proposed edits and suggest follow-ups.

![Review input interface](https://cursor.com/docs-static/images/agent/review/diff-review.png)

### [Source control](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/review\#source-control)

Review all changes against `main`: open the Source Control tab and run Agent Review to review all local changes compared to your main branch.

### [Billing](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/review\#billing)

Running Agent Review triggers an agent run and is billed as a usage-based request.

### [Settings](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/review\#settings)

You can configure Agent Review in the Cursor settings.

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Auto-run on commit** | Scan your code for bugs automatically after each commit |
| **Hide all Agent Review features** | Entirely remove Agent Review from the UI |
| **Include submodules** | Include changes from Git submodules in the review |
| **Include untracked files** | Include untracked files (not yet added to Git) in the review |

## [Review UI](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/review\#review-ui)

After generation completes, you'll see a prompt to review all changes before proceeding. This gives you an overview of what will be modified.

![Review input interface](https://cursor.com/docs-static/images/chat/review/input-review.png)

### [File-by-file](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/review\#file-by-file)

A floating review bar appears at the bottom of your screen, allowing you to:

- **Accept** or **reject** changes for the current file
- Navigate to the **next file** with pending changes



Your browser does not support the video tag.


### [Selective acceptance](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/review\#selective-acceptance)

For fine-grained control:

- To accept most changes: reject unwanted lines, then click **Accept all**
- To reject most changes: accept wanted lines, then click **Reject all**

## [Review changes](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/review\#review-changes)

At the end of the agent response, click the **Review changes** button to see the full diff of the changes.

## [Context windows](https://cursor.com/docs/models\#context-windows)

A [context window](https://cursor.com/learn/context) is the maximum span of tokens (text and code) an LLM can consider at once, including both the input prompt and output generated by the model.

Each chat in Cursor maintains its own context window. The more prompts, attached files, and responses included in a session, the more context is added, filling up the available context window.

Learn more about [working with context](https://cursor.com/learn/context) in Cursor.

## [Max Mode](https://cursor.com/docs/models\#max-mode)

Normally, Cursor uses a context window of 200k tokens (~15,000 lines of code). Max Mode extends the context window to the maximum available for a handful of models. This will be a bit slower and more expensive. It is most relevant for Gemini 2.5 Flash, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT 4.1, and Grok 4, which have context windows larger than 200k.

# Privacy and Data Governance

Understanding how data flows through Cursor is critical for security reviews and compliance assessments. This documentation explains what data goes where, what guarantees you have, and where that data lives geographically.

## [Three data flows](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/privacy-and-data-governance\#three-data-flows)

There are three ways data leaves your local environment when using Cursor:

### [1\. The indexing process](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/privacy-and-data-governance\#1-the-indexing-process)

When you open a project in Cursor, we create embeddings that represent your code. These embeddings power semantic search across your codebase.

**What gets sent:**

- Your code, temporarily, to create embeddings
- Nothing is stored; embeddings are generated and the original code is discarded

**What gets stored:**

- One-way mathematical embeddings (vectors) that represent code semantics
- Obfuscated file paths
- Line numbers

**How it works:**
When you ask a question or use `Cmd K`, we create an embedding from your request and search for similar embeddings in the vector database. The search returns obfuscated file paths and line numbers. We then look up the actual code on your local machine using those coordinates.

The vector database never sees your raw code. It only stores mathematical representations that can't be reverse-engineered back to source code.

### [2\. LLM requests](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/privacy-and-data-governance\#2-llm-requests)

When you use AI features, we send prompts and code context to language model providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google.

**With Privacy Mode enabled:**

- Code is never stored by model providers
- Code is never used for training
- We maintain Zero Data Retention (ZDR) agreements with all providers

**Zero Data Retention agreements:**
We have contractual ZDR policies with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Vertex AI, and xAI Grok. These agreements legally prevent providers from storing inputs or outputs or using your data for training.

Privacy Mode is on by default for Enterprise teams. See [Privacy Overview](https://cursor.com/privacy-overview) for details.

### [3\. Background Agents](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/privacy-and-data-governance\#3-background-agents)

Background Agents are the only feature that requires Cursor to store code. Unlike the indexing process or LLM requests, Background Agents need access to your repository over time to make changes.

**Architecture:**

- Agents run in isolated virtual machines
- Each agent has a dedicated environment
- Isolated from other agents and users

**What gets stored:**

- Encrypted copies of repositories that Background Agents work on
- Stored temporarily while the agent runs
- Deleted after the agent completes

Background Agents are optional. If your security policy prohibits code storage, don't enable Background Agents. You can still use all other Cursor features.

See [Background Agents](https://cursor.com/docs/background-agent) for details.

## [Privacy Mode enforcement](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/privacy-and-data-governance\#privacy-mode-enforcement)

Privacy Mode can be enabled at the team level to ensure all team members benefit from ZDR guarantees.

**Team-level enforcement:**

1. Go to your [team dashboard](https://cursor.com/dashboard)
2. Navigate to Settings
3. Enable Privacy Mode for the team
4. Optionally enforce it so members can't disable it

**MDM enforcement:**
For additional assurance, use the Allowed Team IDs policy. This prevents users from logging into personal accounts (which might not have Privacy Mode enabled) on corporate devices.

See [Identity and Access Management](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/identity-and-access-management#allowed-team-ids) for policy details and [Deployment Patterns](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/deployment-patterns#mdm-configuration) for MDM configuration.

## [Compliance and contracts](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/privacy-and-data-governance\#compliance-and-contracts)

Our [DPA](https://cursor.com/terms/dpa) includes comprehensive data protection commitments that follow industry standards, including data minimization, access control, and secure processing.

All [sub-processors](https://trust.cursor.com/subprocessors) are covered by appropriate data processing agreements.

## [Data encryption](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/privacy-and-data-governance\#data-encryption)

Cursor encrypts data for all infrastructure, including:

- TLS 1.2+ in transit
- AES-256 at rest

For enhanced security control, enterprise customers can use Customer Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) for encrypting data stored in Cursor's infrastructure.

With CMEK enabled:

- Embeddings are encrypted using your customer encryption key
- Background Agent data is encrypted using your customer encryption key
- You control key rotation and access
- Provides additional layer of security beyond standard encryption

Contact your account team to enable CMEK for your organization.

# iOS & macOS (Swift)

Welcome to Swift development in Cursor! Whether you're building iOS apps, macOS applications, or server-side Swift projects, we've got you covered. This guide will help you set up your Swift environment in Cursor, starting with the basics and moving on to more advanced features.

## [Basic Workflow](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/languages/ios-macos-swift\#basic-workflow)

The simplest way to use Cursor with Swift is to treat it as your primary code editor while still relying on Xcode for building and running your apps. You'll get great features like:

- Smart code completion
- AI-powered coding assistance (try [CMD+K](https://cursor.com/docs/inline-edit/overview) on any line)
- Quick access to documentation with [@Docs](https://cursor.com/docs/context/symbols)
- Syntax highlighting
- Basic code navigation

When you need to build or run your app, simply switch to Xcode. This workflow is perfect for developers who want to leverage Cursor's AI capabilities while sticking to familiar Xcode tools for debugging and deployment.

### [Hot Reloading](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/languages/ios-macos-swift\#hot-reloading)

When using Xcode workspaces or projects (instead of opening a folder directly in Xcode), Xcode can often ignore changes to your files that were made in Cursor, or outside of Xcode in general.

While you can open the folder in Xcode to resolve this, you may need to use a project for your Swift development workflow.

A great solution to this is to use [Inject](https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/Inject), a hot reloading library for Swift that allows your app to "hot reload" and update as soon as changes are made in real time. This does not suffer from the side effects of the Xcode workspace/project issue, and allows you to make changes in Cursor and have them reflected in your app immediately.

## [Advanced Swift Development](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/languages/ios-macos-swift\#advanced-swift-development)

This section of the guide was heavily inspired by [Thomas\\
Ricouard](https://x.com/Dimillian) and his
[article](https://dimillian.medium.com/how-to-use-cursor-for-ios-development-54b912c23941)
about using Cursor for iOS development. Please check his article for more
details and drop him a follow for more Swift content.

If you are looking to only need one editor open at a time, and want to avoid the need to switch between Xcode and Cursor, you can use an extension like [Sweetpad](https://sweetpad.hyzyla.dev/) to integrate Cursor directly with Xcode's underlying build system.

Sweetpad is a powerful extension that allows you to build, run and debug your Swift projects directly in Cursor, without compromising on Xcode's features.

To get started with Sweetpad, you'll still need to have Xcode installed on your Mac - it's the foundation of Swift development. You can download Xcode from the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835). Once you have Xcode set up, let's enhance your development experience in Cursor with a few essential tools.

Open your terminal and run:

```
# Builds your projects without needing Xcode open
brew install xcode-build-server

# Pretty print's the `xcodebuild` command output into Cursor's terminal
brew install xcbeautify

# Allows for advanced formating and language features
brew install swiftformat
```

Next, install the [Swift Language Support](cursor:extension/chrisatwindsurf.swift-vscode) extension in Cursor. This will give you syntax highlighting and basic language features right out of the box.

Then, we can install the [Sweetpad](https://sweetpad.hyzyla.dev/) extension to integrate Cursor with Xcode. Sweetpad wraps a bunch of shortcuts around the `xcodebuild` CLI (and much more), and allows you to scan your targets, select the destination, build, and run your app just like Xcode. On top of that, it’ll set up your project for Xcode Build Server so you get all the features mentioned above.

### [Sweetpad Usage](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/languages/ios-macos-swift\#sweetpad-usage)

Once Sweetpad is installed, and you have a Swift project open in Cursor, you should first run the `Sweetpad: Generate Build Server Config` command. This will generate a `buildServer.json` file in the root of your project that allows the Xcode Build Server to work with your project.

Then, from either the Command Palette or the Sweetpad sidebar, you can select the target you want to build and run.

You need to build your project once to enable auto-completion, jump to definition, and other language features.

You can also now hit F5 to build and run your project with a debugger - you might need to create a launch configuration first, but just select Sweetpad from the list when prompted!

As with many extensions in Cursor, you can bind many of the Sweetpad commands to keyboard shortcuts, to make your workflow even more efficient.

# Data Science

Cursor provides integrated tooling for data science development through reproducible environments, notebook
support, and AI-powered code assistance. This guide covers essential setup patterns for Python, R, and SQL
workflows.

## [Notebook development](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/tools/data-science\#notebook-development)

For full notebook support, download the Jupyter (id: ms-toolsai.jupyter) extension, published by ms-toolsai.

Cursor supports both `.ipynb` and `.py` files with integrated cell execution. Tab, Inline Edit, and Agents
work within notebooks, just as they do in other code files.

Key capabilities:

- **Inline cell execution** runs code directly within the editor interface
- **Tab, Inline Edit, and Agent** all understand data science libraries including pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and SQL magic commands

## [Database integration](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/tools/data-science\#database-integration)

Databases can be integrated with Cursor through two main mechanisms: MCP servers and Extensions.

- **MCP Servers** let your Agents connect with your databases
- **Extensions** integrate your broader IDE with your databases

### [Via MCP](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/tools/data-science\#via-mcp)

MCP servers allow your agent to make queries directly against your database. This allows your agent to choose to query your database, write the appropriate query, run the command and analyze outputs, all as part of an ongoing task.

For example, you can connect a Postgres database to your Cursor instance by adding the following [MCP config](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers-archived/tree/main/src/postgres) to Cursor:

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "postgres": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [\
        "-y",\
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres",\
        "postgresql://localhost/mydb"\
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

For more on MCP, see our [MCP documentation](https://cursor.com/docs/context/mcp).

Your browser does not support the video tag.

### [Via Extensions](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/tools/data-science\#via-extensions)

Install database-specific extensions (PostgreSQL, BigQuery, SQLite, Snowflake) to execute queries directly from the editor. This eliminates context switching between tools and enables AI assistance for query optimization.

```
-- Cursor provides suggestions for indexes, window functions, and query optimization
SELECT
    user_id,
    event_type,
    COUNT(*) as event_count,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) as frequency_rank
FROM events
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY user_id, event_type;
```

Use Agents to analyze slow queries, suggest performance improvements, or generate visualization code for query results. Cursor understands SQL context and can recommend appropriate chart types based on your data structure.

![Snowflake Extension](https://cursor.com/docs-static/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs-static%2Fimages%2Fguides%2Fadvanced%2Fdatascience%2Fsnowflake-extension.png&w=1920&q=75)

## [Data visualization](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/tools/data-science\#data-visualization)

Cursor's AI assistance extends to data visualization libraries including Matplotlib, Plotly, and Seaborn. The agent can generate code for data visualization, helping you quickly and easily explore data, while creating a replicable and shareable artifact.

```
import plotly.express as px
import pandas as pd

# AI suggests relevant plot types based on data columns
df = pd.read_csv('sales_data.csv')
fig = px.scatter(df, x='advertising_spend', y='revenue',
                 color='region', size='customer_count',
                 title='Revenue vs Advertising Spend by Region')
fig.show()
```

Your browser does not support the video tag.

## [Frequently asked questions](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/tools/data-science\#frequently-asked-questions)

**Can I use existing Jupyter notebooks?**
Yes, Cursor opens `.ipynb` files with full cell execution and AI completion support.

**How do I handle large datasets that don't fit in memory?**
Use distributed computing libraries like Dask or connect to Spark clusters through Remote-SSH connections to larger machines.

**Does Cursor support R and SQL files?**
Yes, Cursor provides AI assistance and syntax highlighting for R scripts ( `.R`) and SQL files ( `.sql`).

**What's the recommended way to share development environments?**
Commit the `.devcontainer` folder to version control. Team members can rebuild the environment automatically when opening the project.

**How do I debug data processing pipelines?**
Use Cursor's integrated debugger with breakpoints in Python scripts, or leverage Agent to analyze and explain complex data transformations step by step.

## [Environment reproducibility](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/tools/data-science\#environment-reproducibility)

### [Development containers](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/tools/data-science\#development-containers)

Development containers help you ensure consistent runtimes and dependencies across team members and deployment environments. They can eliminate environment-specific bugs and reduce onboarding time for new team members.

To use a development container, start by creating a `.devcontainer` folder in your repository root. Next, create a `devcontainer.json`, `Dockerfile`, and `requirements.txt` file.

```
{
  "name": "ds-env",
  "build": { "dockerfile": "Dockerfile" },
  "features": {
    "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/python:1": { "version": "3.11" }
  },
  "postCreateCommand": "pip install -r requirements.txt"
}
```

```
# .devcontainer/Dockerfile
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/python:3.11
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --upgrade pip && \
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```
# requirements.txt
pandas==2.3.0
numpy
# add other dependencies you need for your project
```

Cursor will automatically detect the devcontainer and prompt you to reopen your project within a container. Alternatively, you can manually reopen in a container using the Command Palette ( `Cmd+Shift+P`) and searching for `Reopen in Container`.

Development containers provide several advantages:

- **Dependency isolation** prevents conflicts between projects
- **Reproducible builds** ensure consistent behavior across development and production environments
- **Simplified onboarding** allows new team members to start immediately without manual setup

### [Remote development with SSH](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/tools/data-science\#remote-development-with-ssh)

When your analysis requires additional compute resources, GPUs, or access to private datasets, connect to remote machines while maintaining your local development environment.

1. Provision a cloud instance or access an on-premises server with required resources
2. Clone your repository to the remote machine, including the `.devcontainer` configuration
3. Connect through Cursor: `Cmd+Shift+P` → "Remote-SSH: Connect to Host"

This approach maintains consistent tooling while scaling compute resources as needed. The same development container configuration works across local and remote environments.

# Permissions

Configure what the agent is allowed to do using permission tokens in your CLI configuration. Permissions are set in `~/.cursor/cli-config.json` (global) or `<project>/.cursor/cli.json` (project-specific).

## [Permission types](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/reference/permissions\#permission-types)

### [Shell commands](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/reference/permissions\#shell-commands)

**Format:** `Shell(commandBase)`

Controls access to shell commands. The `commandBase` is the first token in the command line.

| Example | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Shell(ls)` | Allow running `ls` commands |
| `Shell(git)` | Allow any `git` subcommand |
| `Shell(npm)` | Allow npm package manager commands |
| `Shell(rm)` | Deny destructive file removal (commonly in `deny`) |

### [File reads](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/reference/permissions\#file-reads)

**Format:** `Read(pathOrGlob)`

Controls read access to files and directories. Supports glob patterns.

| Example | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Read(src/**/*.ts)` | Allow reading TypeScript files in `src` |
| `Read(**/*.md)` | Allow reading markdown files anywhere |
| `Read(.env*)` | Deny reading environment files |
| `Read(/etc/passwd)` | Deny reading system files |

### [File writes](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/reference/permissions\#file-writes)

**Format:** `Write(pathOrGlob)`

Controls write access to files and directories. Supports glob patterns. When using in print mode, `--force` is required to write files.

| Example | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Write(src/**)` | Allow writing to any file under `src` |
| `Write(package.json)` | Allow modifying package.json |
| `Write(**/*.key)` | Deny writing private key files |
| `Write(**/.env*)` | Deny writing environment files |

## [Configuration](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/reference/permissions\#configuration)

Add permissions to the `permissions` object in your CLI configuration file:

```
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [\
      "Shell(ls)",\
      "Shell(git)",\
      "Read(src/**/*.ts)",\
      "Write(package.json)"\
    ],
    "deny": ["Shell(rm)", "Read(.env*)", "Write(**/*.key)"]
  }
}
```

## [Pattern matching](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/reference/permissions\#pattern-matching)

- Glob patterns use `**`, `*`, and `?` wildcards
- Relative paths are scoped to the current workspace
- Absolute paths can target files outside the project
- Deny rules take precedence over allow rules

# Summarization

## [Message summarization](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/chat/summarization\#message-summarization)

As conversations grow longer, Cursor automatically summarizes and manages context to keep your chats efficient. Learn how to use the context menu and understand how files are condensed to fit within model context windows.

### [Using the /summarize command](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/chat/summarization\#using-the-summarize-command)

You can manually trigger summarization using the `/summarize` command in chat. This command helps manage context when conversations become too long, allowing you to continue working efficiently without losing important information.

New to Cursor? Learn more about [Context](https://cursor.com/learn/context).

### [How summarization works](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/chat/summarization\#how-summarization-works)

When conversations grow longer, they exceed the model's context window limit:

User

Cursor

User

Context window limit

Cursor

## [File & folder condensation](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/chat/summarization\#file-folder-condensation)

While chat summarization handles long conversations, Cursor uses a different strategy for managing large files and folders: **smart condensation**. When you include files in your conversation, Cursor determines the best way to present them based on their size and available context space.

Here are the different states a file/folder can be in:

### [Condensed](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/chat/summarization\#condensed)

When files or folders are too large to fit within the context window, Cursor automatically condenses them. Condensing shows the model key structural elements like function signatures, classes, and methods. From this condensed view, the model can choose to expand specific files if needed. This approach maximizes effective use of the available context window.

![Context menu](https://cursor.com/docs-static/images/context/context-management/condensed.png)

### [Significantly condensed](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/chat/summarization\#significantly-condensed)

When a file name appears with a "Significantly Condensed" label, the file was too large to include in full, even in condensed form. Only the file name will be shown to the model.

### [Not included](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/chat/summarization\#not-included)

When a warning icon appears next to a file or folder, the item is too large to be included in the context window, even in condensed form. This helps you understand which parts of your codebase are accessible to the model.

# Usage and Spend Controls

This documentation covers how to enable usage-based pricing, set spending limits, and monitor usage across your team.

## [Usage-based pricing](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/usage-and-spend-controls\#usage-based-pricing)

To enable usage-based pricing, an admin must:

1. Go to your [team dashboard](https://cursor.com/dashboard)
2. Navigate to Settings
3. Find "Usage-Based Pricing Settings"
4. Enable usage-based pricing
5. Add a payment method

Usage-based pricing requires:

- Team plan or Enterprise plan
- Valid payment method on file
- Admin access to enable

Enterprise plans offer pooled usage across the organization for flexible allocation.

See [Pricing](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/pricing) for current rates.

## [Spending limits](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/usage-and-spend-controls\#spending-limits)

Set spending limits to control costs and prevent unexpected charges.

### [Team spending limits](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/usage-and-spend-controls\#team-spending-limits)

Set a monthly spending limit for your entire team:

1. Go to [team dashboard](https://cursor.com/dashboard)
2. Navigate to Settings > Usage-Based Pricing Settings
3. Set "Team Spending Limit"
4. Choose monthly amount

**Behavior when limit is reached:**

- AI features stop working for all team members
- Users see a message that the spending limit was reached
- Admins receive email notification
- Non-AI features continue working normally

### [Per-user spending limits](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/usage-and-spend-controls\#per-user-spending-limits)

Set individual spending limits for each team member:

1. Go to [team dashboard](https://cursor.com/dashboard)
2. Navigate to Settings > Usage-Based Pricing Settings
3. Set "Per-User Spending Limit"
4. This applies to all users or specific users

**Behavior when limit is reached:**

- AI features stop working for that specific user
- Other team members continue unaffected
- User sees notification of personal limit reached
- Admins can increase individual limits as needed

## [Monitoring usage](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/usage-and-spend-controls\#monitoring-usage)

Track usage to understand costs, identify high-usage periods, and optimize spending.

### [Team dashboard](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/usage-and-spend-controls\#team-dashboard)

The [team dashboard](https://cursor.com/dashboard) shows usage metrics including total spending, spending by day, top users by spending, and model usage breakdown.

Admins can:

- Monitor usage in real-time via the analytics dashboard\]
- Track team performance and individual user adoption
- View detailed breakdowns of individual users, including lines of code written and AI feature adoption

### [Admin API](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/usage-and-spend-controls\#admin-api)

Query usage data programmatically using the [Admin API](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/admin-api):

```
curl -X POST "https://api.cursor.com/teams/daily-usage-data" \
  -u YOUR_API_KEY: \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"startDate": 1710720000000, "endDate": 1710892800000}'
```

Available endpoints:

- `POST /teams/daily-usage-data` \- Team usage summary and analytics
- `POST /teams/filtered-usage-events` \- Detailed usage events with filtering
- `POST /teams/spend` \- Team spending data and member costs

See [Admin API documentation](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/admin-api) for complete reference.

### [Analytics API v2](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/usage-and-spend-controls\#analytics-api-v2)

For deeper analytics, use the [Analytics v2 API](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/analytics-v2):

Our new Analytics API provides granular usage metrics, custom date ranges, filtering by user, model, or project, and export to CSV or JSON.

### [AI Code Tracking API](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/usage-and-spend-controls\#ai-code-tracking-api)

The [AI Code Tracking API](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/ai-code-tracking-api) provides granular metrics on AI-generated code. This is an Enterprise-only feature for measuring AI adoption and productivity.

Track metrics including:

- Lines of code accepted from AI suggestions
- Per-commit AI usage metrics
- Model attribution for generated code
- Repository-level statistics
- User-level productivity metrics

```
curl -X GET "https://api.cursor.com/analytics/ai-code/commits" \
  -u YOUR_API_KEY: \
  -d "startDate=7d&endDate=now"
```

See [AI Code Tracking API](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/ai-code-tracking-api) for full documentation.

## [Cost optimization strategies](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/usage-and-spend-controls\#cost-optimization-strategies)

Reduce spending while maintaining productivity:

### [Model selection](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/usage-and-spend-controls\#model-selection)

Different [models](https://cursor.com/docs/models) have different costs. Ensure you configure [model access controls](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/model-and-integration-management) to use the most cost-effective models for your team.

### [Context management](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/usage-and-spend-controls\#context-management)

Additional context means more tokens, which leads to higher usage.

- Only include relevant files in context
- Avoid including entire repositories in prompts
- Use specific file references rather than broad searches

Learn more about [context](https://cursor.com/docs/learn/context).

```

## [Cookbook examples](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/github-actions\#cookbook-examples)

See our cookbook examples for practical workflows: [updating documentation](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/cookbook/update-docs) and [fixing CI issues](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/cookbook/fix-ci).

## [Other CI systems](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/github-actions\#other-ci-systems)

Use Cursor CLI in any CI/CD system with:

- **Shell script execution** (bash, zsh, etc.)
- **Environment variables** for API key configuration
- **Internet connectivity** to reach Cursor's API

## [Autonomy levels](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/github-actions\#autonomy-levels)

Choose your agent's autonomy level:

### [Full autonomy approach](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/github-actions\#full-autonomy-approach)

Give the agent complete control over git operations, API calls, and external interactions. Simpler setup, requires more trust.

**Example:** In our [Update Documentation](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/cookbook/update-docs) cookbook, the first workflow lets the agent:

- Analyze PR changes
- Create and manage git branches
- Commit and push changes
- Post comments on pull requests
- Handle all error scenarios

```
- name: Update docs (full autonomy)
  run: |
    cursor-agent -p "You have full access to git, GitHub CLI, and PR operations.
    Handle the entire docs update workflow including commits, pushes, and PR comments."
```

### [Restricted autonomy approach](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/github-actions\#restricted-autonomy-approach)

We recommend using this approach with **permission-based restrictions** for
production CI workflows. This gives you the best of both worlds: the agent can
intelligently handle complex analysis and file modifications while critical
operations remain deterministic and auditable.

Limit agent operations while handling critical steps in separate workflow steps. Better control and predictability.

**Example:** The second workflow in the same cookbook restricts the agent to only file modifications:

```
- name: Generate docs updates (restricted)

### [Permission-based restrictions](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/github-actions\#permission-based-restrictions)

Use [permission configurations](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/reference/permissions) to enforce restrictions at the CLI level:

```
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [\
      "Read(**/*.md)",\
      "Write(docs/**/*)",\
      "Shell(grep)",\
      "Shell(find)"\
    ],
    "deny": ["Shell(git)", "Shell(gh)", "Write(.env*)", "Write(package.json)"]
  }
}
```

## [Authentication](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/github-actions\#authentication)

### [Generate your API key](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/github-actions\#generate-your-api-key)

First, [generate an API key](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/reference/authentication#api-key-authentication) from your Cursor dashboard.

### [Configure repository secrets](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/github-actions\#configure-repository-secrets)

Store your Cursor API key securely in your repository using the GitHub CLI:

```
# Repository secret
gh secret set CURSOR_API_KEY --repo OWNER/REPO --body "$CURSOR_API_KEY"

# Organization secret (all repos)
gh secret set CURSOR_API_KEY --org ORG --visibility all --body "$CURSOR_API_KEY"
```

Alternatively, use the GitHub UI: Go to your repository → **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions** → **New repository secret**

### [Use in workflows](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/github-actions\#use-in-workflows)

Set your `CURSOR_API_KEY` environment variable:

```
env:
  CURSOR_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.CURSOR_API_KEY }}
```

# Getting a Request ID

When the Cursor team is investigating a technical issue, we may ask for a "request ID".

## [What is a request ID?](https://cursor.com/docs/troubleshooting/request-reporting\#what-is-a-request-id)

A request ID uniquely identifies each request to Cursor in our internal systems.

Format example: `8f2a5b91-4d3e-47c6-9f12-5e8d94ca7d23`

## [How do I find a request ID?](https://cursor.com/docs/troubleshooting/request-reporting\#how-do-i-find-a-request-id)

Request IDs are limited when Privacy Mode is enabled. Disable Privacy Mode when reporting issues.

Note: Business plan users have Privacy Mode enabled by default by their organization's admin.

### [Getting your current request ID](https://cursor.com/docs/troubleshooting/request-reporting\#getting-your-current-request-id)

To report an issue with your current or recent conversation:

With the conversation open in the Chat sidebar, use the context menu (top right) and select `Copy Request ID`.

![Request ID popup](https://cursor.com/docs-static/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs-static%2Fimages%2FrequestIDpopup.png&w=1920&q=75)

Send the copied request ID to us via the forum or email as requested.

### [Getting a request ID from a previous action](https://cursor.com/docs/troubleshooting/request-reporting\#getting-a-request-id-from-a-previous-action)

Retrieve historical request IDs using the `Report AI Action` command:

1. Open command palette `⌘⇧P`
2. Type `Report AI Action`
3. Select the `Report AI Action` option

This displays your recent AI actions across Chat, CMD+K, and Apply.

![Request ID list](https://cursor.com/docs-static/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs-static%2Fimages%2FrequestIDlist.png&w=1920&q=75)

Select the action by matching its time and feature. Copy the request ID and send it to us.

# Secret Audit with Cursor CLI

Audit your repository for security vulnerabilities and secrets exposure using Cursor CLI. This workflow scans for potential secrets, detects risky workflow patterns, and proposes security fixes.

**Example: `.github/workflows/secret-audit.yml`**

```
name: Secrets Audit

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 4 * * *"
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write
  actions: read

jobs:
  secrets-audit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Install Cursor CLI
        run: |
          curl https://cursor.com/install -fsS | bash
          echo "$HOME/.cursor/bin" >> $GITHUB_PATH

      - name: Configure git identity
        run: |
          git config user.name "Cursor Agent"
          git config user.email "cursoragent@cursor.com"

      - name: Scan and propose hardening
        env:
          CURSOR_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.CURSOR_API_KEY }}
          MODEL: gpt-5
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          BRANCH_PREFIX: audit
        run: |
          cursor-agent -p "You are operating in a GitHub Actions runner.

          The GitHub CLI is available as `gh` and authenticated via `GH_TOKEN`. Git is available. You have write access to repository contents and can comment on pull requests, but you must not create or edit PRs directly.

          # Context:
          - Repo: ${{ github.repository }}
           - Hardening Branch Prefix: ${{ env.BRANCH_PREFIX }}

          # Goal:
          - Perform a repository secrets exposure and workflow hardening audit on a schedule, and propose minimal safe fixes.

          # Requirements:
          1) Scan for potential secrets in tracked files and recent history; support allowlist patterns if present (e.g., .gitleaks.toml).
          2) Detect risky workflow patterns: unpinned actions, overbroad permissions, unsafe pull_request_target usage, secrets in forked PR contexts, deprecated insecure commands, missing permissions blocks.
          3) Maintain a persistent branch for this run using the Hardening Branch Prefix from Context. Create it if missing, update it otherwise, and push changes to origin.
          4) Propose minimal edits: redact literals where safe, add ignore rules, pin actions to SHA, reduce permissions, add guardrails to workflows, and add a SECURITY_LOG.md summarizing changes and remediation guidance.
          5) Push to origin.
          6) If there is at least one open PR in the repo, post or update a single natural-language comment (1–2 sentences) on the most recently updated open PR that briefly explains the hardening changes and includes an inline compare link to quick-create a PR.
          7) Avoid duplicate comments; update an existing bot comment if present. If no changes or no open PRs, post nothing.

          # Inputs and conventions:
          - Use `gh` to list PRs and to post comments. Avoid duplicate comments.

          # Deliverables when updates occur:
           - Pushed commits to the persistent hardening branch for this run.
          - A single natural-language PR comment with the compare link above (only if an open PR exists).

# Planning

Agent can plan ahead and manage complex tasks with structured to-do lists and message queuing, making long-horizon tasks easier to understand and track.

## [Plan Mode](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/planning\#plan-mode)

Plan Mode creates detailed implementation plans before writing any code. Agent researches your codebase, asks clarifying questions, and generates a reviewable plan you can edit before building.

Press `Shift+Tab` from the chat input to rotate to Plan Mode. Cursor also suggests it automatically when you type keywords that indicate complex tasks.

![Plan Mode](https://cursor.com/docs-static/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs-static%2Fimages%2Fagent%2Fplanning%2Fplan-mode.png&w=1920&q=75)

### [How it works](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/planning\#how-it-works)

1. Agent asks clarifying questions to understand your requirements
2. Researches your codebase to gather relevant context
3. Creates a comprehensive implementation plan
4. You review and edit the plan through chat or markdown files
5. Click to build the plan when ready

Plans open as ephemeral virtual files that you can view and edit. To save a plan to your workspace, click "Save to workspace" to store it in `.cursor/plans/` for future reference, team sharing, and documentation.

## [Agent to-dos](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/planning\#agent-to-dos)

Agent can break down longer tasks into manageable steps with dependencies, creating a structured plan that updates as work progresses.

### [How it works](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/planning\#how-it-works-1)

- Agent automatically creates to-do lists for complex tasks
- Each item can have dependencies on other tasks
- The list updates in real-time as work progresses
- Completed tasks are marked off automatically

### [Visibility](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/planning\#visibility)

- To-dos appear in the chat interface
- If [Slack integration](https://cursor.com/docs/integrations/slack) is set up, to-dos are also visible there
- You can view the full task breakdown at any time

For better planning, describe your end goal clearly. Agent will create more
accurate task breakdowns when it understands the full scope.

## [Queued messages](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/planning\#queued-messages)

Queue follow-up messages while Agent is working on the current task. Your instructions wait in line and execute automatically when ready.

### [Using the queue](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/planning\#using-the-queue)

1. While Agent is working, type your next instruction
2. Press `Ctrl+Enter` to add it to the queue
3. Messages appear in order below the active task
4. Reorder queued messages by clicking arrow
5. Agent processes them sequentially after finishing

### [Override the queue](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/planning\#override-the-queue)

To queue your message instead of using default messaging, use `Ctrl+Enter`. To send a message immediately without queuing, use `Cmd+Enter`. This "force pushes" your message, bypassing the queue to execute right away.

## [Default messaging](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/planning\#default-messaging)

Messages send as fast as possible by default, typically appearing right after Agent completes a tool call. This creates the most responsive experience.

### [How default messaging works](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/planning\#how-default-messaging-works)

- Your message gets appended to the most recent user message in the chat
- Messages typically attach to tool results and send immediately when ready
- This creates a more natural conversation flow without interrupting Agent's current work
- By default, this happens when you press Enter while Agent is working

# Members & Roles

Cursor teams have three roles:

## [Roles](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/members\#roles)

**Members** are the default role with access to Cursor's Pro features.

- Full access to Cursor's Pro features
- No access to billing settings or admin dashboard
- Can see their own usage and remaining usage-based budget

**Admins** control team management and security settings.

- Full access to Pro features
- Add/remove members, modify roles, setup SSO
- Configure usage-based pricing and spending limits
- Access to team analytics

**Unpaid Admins** manage teams without using a paid seat - ideal for IT or finance staff who don't need Cursor access.

- Not billable, no Pro features
- Same administrative capabilities as Admins

Unpaid Admins require at least one paid user on the team.

## [Role Comparison](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/members\#role-comparison)

| Capability | Member | Admin | Unpaid Admin |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Use Cursor features | ✓ | ✓ |  |
| Invite members | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Remove members |  | ✓ | ✓ |
| Change user role |  | ✓ | ✓ |
| Admin dashboard |  | ✓ | ✓ |
| Configure SSO/Security |  | ✓ | ✓ |
| Manage Billing |  | ✓ | ✓ |
| View Analytics |  | ✓ | ✓ |
| Manage Access |  | ✓ | ✓ |
| Set usage controls |  | ✓ | ✓ |
| Requires paid seat | ✓ | ✓ |  |

## [Managing members](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/members\#managing-members)

All team members can invite others. We don't currently control invites.

### [Add member](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/members\#add-member)

Add members three ways:

1. **Email invitation**
   - Click `Invite Members`
   - Enter email addresses
   - Users receive email invites
2. **Invite link**
   - Click `Invite Members`
   - Copy `Invite Link`
   - Share with team members
3. **SSO**
   - Configure SSO in [admin dashboard](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/sso)
   - Users auto-join when logging in via SSO email

Invite links have a long expiration date - anyone with the link can join.
Revoke them or use [SSO](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/sso)

### [Remove member](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/members\#remove-member)

Admins can remove members anytime via context menu → "Remove".

**Billing:**

- If a member has used any credits, their seat remains occupied until the end of the billing cycle
- Billing is automatically adjusted with pro-rated credit for removed members applied to the next invoice

**Data deletion:**

- When a user is removed from the team, their data (including Memories and Background Agent data) is permanently deleted
- When an entire team is deleted, all associated data is permanently deleted
- There must be at least one Admin and one paid member on the team at all times

### [Change role](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/members\#change-role)

Admins can change roles for other members by clicking the context menu and then use the "Change role" option.

There must be at least one Admin, and one paid member on the team at all times.

## [Security & SSO](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/members\#security-sso)

SAML 2.0 Single Sign-On (SSO) is available on Team plans. Key features include:

- Configure SSO connections ( [learn more](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/sso))
- Set up domain verification
- Automatic user enrollment
- SSO enforcement options
- Identity provider integration (Okta, etc)

Domain verification is required to enable SSO.

![](https://cursor.com/docs-static/images/account/sso-settings.png)

## [Usage Controls](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/members\#usage-controls)

Access usage settings to:

- Enable usage-based pricing
- Enable for premium models
- Set admin-only modifications
- Set monthly spending limits
- Monitor team-wide usage

![](https://cursor.com/docs-static/images/account/usage-based-pricing.png)

## [Billing](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/members\#billing)

When adding team members:

- Each member or admin adds a billable seat (see [pricing](https://cursor.com/pricing))
- New members are charged pro-rata for their remaining time in the billing period
- Unpaid admin seats aren't counted

Mid-month additions charge only for days used. When removing members who have used credits, their seat remains occupied until the end of the billing cycle - no pro-rated refunds are given.

Role changes (e.g., Admin to Unpaid Admin) adjust billing from the change date. Choose monthly or yearly billing.

Monthly/yearly renewal occurs on your original signup date, regardless of member changes.

### [Switch to Yearly billing](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/members\#switch-to-yearly-billing)

Save **20%** by switching from monthly to yearly:

1. Go to [Dashboard](https://cursor.com/dashboard)
2. In account section, click "Advanced" then "Upgrade to yearly billing"

You can only switch from monthly to yearly via dashboard. To switch from
yearly to monthly, contact [hi@cursor.com](mailto:hi@cursor.com).

# AI Code Tracking API

Access AI-generated code analytics for your team's repositories. This includes per-commit AI usage as well as granular accepted AI changes.

The API is in its first release. We're expanding capabilities based on
feedback - let us know what endpoints you need!

- **Availability**: Only for enterprise teams
- **Status**: Alpha (response shapes and fields may change)

## [Authentication](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/ai-code-tracking-api\#authentication)

All API requests require authentication using an API key. This API uses the same Admin API authentication as other endpoints.

For detailed authentication instructions, see [Admin API authentication](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/admin-api#authentication).

## [Base URL](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/ai-code-tracking-api\#base-url)

All API endpoints use:

```
https://api.cursor.com
```

## [Rate Limits](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/ai-code-tracking-api\#rate-limits)

- 20 requests per minute per team, per endpoint

## [Query Parameters](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/ai-code-tracking-api\#query-parameters)

All endpoints below accept the same query parameters via query string:

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `startDate` | string \| date | No | ISO date string, the literal "now", or relative days like "7d" (means now - 7 days). Default: now - 7 days |
| `endDate` | string \| date | No | ISO date string, the literal "now", or relative days like "0d". Default: now |
| `page` | number | No | Page number (1-based). Default: 1 |
| `pageSize` | number | No | Results per page. Default: 100, Max: 1000 |
| `user` | string | No | Optional filter by a single user. Accepts email (e.g., [developer@company.com](mailto:developer@company.com)), encoded ID (e.g., user\_abc123...), or numeric ID (e.g., 42) |

Responses return userId as an encoded external ID with the prefix user\_. This
is stable for API consumption.

## [Semantics and How Metrics Are Computed](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/ai-code-tracking-api\#semantics-and-how-metrics-are-computed)

- **Sources**: "TAB" represents inline completions that were accepted; "COMPOSER" represents accepted diffs from Composer
- **Lines metrics**: tabLinesAdded/Deleted and composerLinesAdded/Deleted are separately counted; nonAiLinesAdded/Deleted are derived as max(0, totalLines - AI lines)
- **Privacy mode**: If enabled in the client, some metadata (like fileName) may be omitted
- **Branch info**: isPrimaryBranch is true when the current branch equals the repo's default branch; may be undefined if repo info is unavailable

You can scan that file to understand how commits and changes are detected and reported.

## [Tips](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/ai-code-tracking-api\#tips)

- Use `user` parameter to quickly filter a single user across all endpoints
- For large data extractions, prefer CSV endpoints—they stream in pages of 10,000 records server-side
- `isPrimaryBranch` may be undefined if the client couldn't resolve the default branch
- `commitTs` is the commit timestamp; `createdAt` is the ingestion time on our servers
- Some fields may be absent when privacy mode is enabled on the client
- Commit hashes are not unique or unchangeable. For example, you may see the same commit twice if you amend commits with extra information.
- Commit timestamps will remain unchanged even if the commit is amended.

## [Changelog](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/ai-code-tracking-api\#changelog)

- **Alpha release**: Initial endpoints for commits and changes. Response shapes may evolve based on feedback

# Rules

Rules provide system-level instructions to Agent and Inline Edit. They are persistent context, preferences, or workflows for your projects.

Cursor supports four types of rules:

Project Rules

Stored in `.cursor/rules`, version-controlled and scoped to your codebase.

User Rules

Global to your Cursor environment. Defined in settings and always applied.

Team Rules

Team-wide rules managed from the dashboard. Available on Team and [Enterprise](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise) plans.

AGENTS.md

Agent instructions in markdown format. Simple alternative to
`.cursor/rules`.

## [How rules work](https://cursor.com/docs/context/rules\#how-rules-work)

Large language models don't retain memory between completions. Rules provide persistent, reusable context at the prompt level.

When applied, rule contents are included at the start of the model context. This gives the AI consistent guidance for generating code, interpreting edits, or helping with workflows.

![Rule applied in context with chat](https://cursor.com/docs-static/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs-static%2Fimages%2Fcontext%2Frules%2Frules-applied.png&w=1920&q=75)

Rules apply to [Chat](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/overview) and [Inline\\
Edit](https://cursor.com/docs/inline-edit/overview). Active rules show in the Agent sidebar.

## [Project rules](https://cursor.com/docs/context/rules\#project-rules)

Project rules live in `.cursor/rules`. Each rule is a file and version-controlled. They are scoped using path patterns, invoked manually, or included based on relevance. Subdirectories include their own `.cursor/rules` directory scoped to that folder.

Use project rules to:

- Encode domain-specific knowledge about your codebase
- Automate project-specific workflows or templates
- Standardize style or architecture decisions

### [Rule anatomy](https://cursor.com/docs/context/rules\#rule-anatomy)

Each rule file is written in **MDC** ( `.mdc`), a format supporting metadata and content. Control how rules are applied from the type dropdown which changes properties `description`, `globs`, `alwaysApply`.

| Rule Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Always` | Always included in model context |
| `Auto Attached` | Included when files matching a glob pattern are referenced |
| `Manual` | Only included when explicitly mentioned using `@ruleName` |

```
---
description: RPC Service boilerplate
globs: ["**/*.ts", "**/*.tsx"]
alwaysApply: false
---

- Use our internal RPC pattern when defining services
- Always use snake_case for service names.

@service-template.ts
```

### [Nested rules](https://cursor.com/docs/context/rules\#nested-rules)

Organize rules by placing them in `.cursor/rules` directories throughout your project. Nested rules automatically attach when files in their directory are referenced.

```
project/
  .cursor/rules/        # Project-wide rules
  backend/
    server/
      .cursor/rules/    # Backend-specific rules
  frontend/
    .cursor/rules/      # Frontend-specific rules
```

### [Creating a rule](https://cursor.com/docs/context/rules\#creating-a-rule)

Create rules using the `New Cursor Rule` command or going to `Cursor Settings > Rules`. This creates a new rule file in `.cursor/rules`. From settings you can see all rules and their status.

![Comparison of concise vs long rules](https://cursor.com/docs-static/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs-static%2Fimages%2Fcontext%2Frules%2Frule-settings.png&w=1920&q=75)

### [Generating rules](https://cursor.com/docs/context/rules\#generating-rules)

Generate rules directly in conversations using the `/Generate Cursor Rules` command. Useful when you've made decisions about agent behavior and want to reuse them.

Your browser does not support the video tag.

## [Best practices](https://cursor.com/docs/context/rules\#best-practices)

Good rules are focused, actionable, and scoped.

- Keep rules under 500 lines
- Split large rules into multiple, composable rules
- Provide concrete examples or referenced files
- Avoid vague guidance. Write rules like clear internal docs
- Reuse rules when repeating prompts in chat

## [Examples](https://cursor.com/docs/context/rules\#examples)

### Standards for frontend components and API validation

### Templates for Express services and React components

### Automating development workflows and documentation generation

### Adding a new setting in Cursor

Examples are available from providers and frameworks. Community-contributed rules are found across crowdsourced collections and repositories online.

## [Team Rules](https://cursor.com/docs/context/rules\#team-rules)

Team and [Enterprise](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise) plans can create and enforce rules across their entire organization from the [Cursor dashboard](https://cursor.com/dashboard?tab=team-content). Admins can configure whether or not each rule is required for team members.

Team Rules work alongside other rule types and take precedence to ensure organizational standards are maintained across all projects. They provide a powerful way to ensure consistent coding standards, practices, and workflows across your entire team without requiring individual setup or configuration.

### [Managing Team Rules](https://cursor.com/docs/context/rules\#managing-team-rules)

Team administrators can create and manage rules directly from the Cursor dashboard:

![Empty team rules dashboard where team administrators can add new rules](https://cursor.com/docs-static/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs-static%2Fimages%2Fcontext%2Frules%2Fteam-rules-empty.png&w=1920&q=75)

Once team rules are created, they automatically apply to all team members and are visible in the dashboard:

![Team rules dashboard showing a single team rule that will be enforced for all team members](https://cursor.com/docs-static/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs-static%2Fimages%2Fcontext%2Frules%2Fteam-rules-1.png&w=1920&q=75)

### [Activation and enforcement](https://cursor.com/docs/context/rules\#activation-and-enforcement)

- **Enable this rule immediately**: When checked, the rule is active as soon as you create it. When unchecked, the rule is saved as a draft and does not apply until you enable it later.
- **Enforce this rule**: When enabled, the rule is required for all team members and cannot be disabled in their Cursor settings. When not enforced, team members can toggle the rule off in `Cursor Settings → Rules` under the Team Rules section.

By default, non‑enforced Team Rules can be disabled by users. Use **Enforce this rule** to prevent that.

### [Format and how Team Rules are applied](https://cursor.com/docs/context/rules\#format-and-how-team-rules-are-applied)

- **Plain text, no MDC**: Team Rules are free‑form text. They do not use the MDC format and do not support metadata such as `globs`, `alwaysApply`, or rule types.
- **Where they apply**: When a Team Rule is enabled (and not disabled by the user, unless enforced), it is included in the model context for both Agent (Chat) and Inline Edit across all repositories and projects for that team.
- **Precedence**: Rules are applied in this order: **Team Rules → Project Rules → User Rules**. All applicable rules are merged; earlier sources take precedence when guidance conflicts.

Some teams use enforced rules as part of internal compliance workflows. While this is supported, AI guidance should not be your only security control.

## [AGENTS.md](https://cursor.com/docs/context/rules\#agentsmd)

`AGENTS.md` is a simple markdown file for defining agent instructions. Place it in your project root as an alternative to `.cursor/rules` for straightforward use cases.

Unlike Project Rules, `AGENTS.md` is a plain markdown file without metadata or complex configurations. It's perfect for projects that need simple, readable instructions without the overhead of structured rules.

Cursor supports AGENTS.md in the project root and subdirectories.

```
# Project Instructions

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all new files
- Prefer functional components in React
- Use snake_case for database columns

## Architecture

- Follow the repository pattern
- Keep business logic in service layers
```

### [Improvements](https://cursor.com/docs/context/rules\#improvements)

### Nested AGENTS.md support

## [User Rules](https://cursor.com/docs/context/rules\#user-rules)

User rules are global preferences defined in **Cursor Settings → Rules** that apply across all projects. They're plain text and perfect for setting preferred communication style or coding conventions:

```
Please reply in a concise style. Avoid unnecessary repetition or filler language.
```

## [`.cursorrules`](https://cursor.com/docs/context/rules\#cursorrules)

The `.cursorrules` (legacy) file in your project root is still supported but **will be deprecated**. We recommend migrating to Project Rules or to `AGENTS.md`.

## [FAQ](https://cursor.com/docs/context/rules\#faq)

### Why isn't my rule being applied?

### Can rules reference other rules or files?

### Can I create a rule from chat?

### How do I migrate legacy Agent Applied rules?

### Do rules impact Cursor Tab or other AI features?

# SSO

## [Overview](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/sso\#overview)

SAML 2.0 SSO is available at no additional cost on Business plans. Use your existing identity provider (IdP) to authenticate team members without separate Cursor accounts.

![](https://cursor.com/docs-static/images/account/sso-settings.png)

## [Prerequisites](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/sso\#prerequisites)

- Cursor Team plan
- Admin access to your identity provider (e.g., Okta)
- Admin access to your Cursor organization

## [Configuration Steps](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/sso\#configuration-steps)

1

### Sign in to your Cursor account

Navigate to [cursor.com/dashboard?tab=settings](https://www.cursor.com/dashboard?tab=settings) with an admin account.

2

### Locate the SSO configuration

Find the "Single Sign-On (SSO)" section and expand it.

3

### Begin the setup process

Click the "SSO Provider Connection settings"button to start SSO setup and follow the wizard.

4

### Configure your identity provider

In your identity provider (e.g., Okta):

- Create new SAML application
- Configure SAML settings using Cursor's information
- Set up Just-in-Time (JIT) provisioning

5

### Verify domain

Verify the domain of your users in Cursor by clicking the "Domain verification settings" button.

### [Identity Provider Setup Guides](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/sso\#identity-provider-setup-guides)

For provider-specific setup instructions:

[Identity Provider Guides\\
\\
Setup instructions for Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace, and more.](https://workos.com/docs/integrations)

## [Additional Settings](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/sso\#additional-settings)

- Manage SSO enforcement through admin dashboard
- New users auto-enroll when signing in through SSO
- Handle user management through your identity provider

## [Multiple domains](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/sso\#multiple-domains)

To handle multiple domains in your organization:

1. **Verify each domain separately** in Cursor through the domain verification settings
2. **Configure each domain** in your identity provider
3. Each domain needs to go through the verification process independently

## [Troubleshooting](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/sso\#troubleshooting)

If issues occur:

- Verify domain is verified in Cursor
- Ensure SAML attributes are properly mapped
- Check SSO is enabled in admin dashboard
- Match first and last names between identity provider and Cursor
- Check provider-specific guides above
- Contact [hi@cursor.com](mailto:hi@cursor.com) if issues persist

# JetBrains Migration

Cursor offers a modern, AI-powered coding experience that can replace your JetBrains IDEs. While the transition might feel different at first, Cursor's VS Code-based foundation provides powerful features and extensive customization options.

Don't want to migrate? You can still use [Cursor CLI](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/overview) with your JetBrains IDEs.

## [Editor Components](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/migrations/jetbrains\#editor-components)

### [Extensions](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/migrations/jetbrains\#extensions)

JetBrains IDEs are great tools, as they come already pre-configured for the languages and frameworks they are intended for.

Cursor is different - being a blank canvas out of the box, you can customize it to your liking, not being limited by the languages and frameworks the IDE was intended for.

Cursor has access to a vast ecosystem of extensions, and almost all of the functionality (and more!) that JetBrains IDEs offer can be recreated through these extensions.

Take a look at some of these popular extensions below:

- **[Remote SSH](cursor:extension/anysphere.remote-ssh)** \- SSH Extension
- **[Project Manager](cursor:extension/alefragnani.project-manager)** \- Manage multiple projects
- **[GitLens](cursor:extension/eamodio.gitlens)** \- Enhanced Git integration
- **[Local History](cursor:extension/xyz.local-history)** \- Track local file changes
- **[Error Lens](cursor:extension/usernamehw.errorlens)** \- Inline error highlighting
- **[ESLint](cursor:extension/dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)** \- Code linting
- **[Prettier](cursor:extension/esbenp.prettier-vscode)** \- Code formatting
- **[Todo Tree](cursor:extension/Gruntfuggly.todo-tree)** \- Track TODOs and FIXMEs

### [Keyboard Shortcuts](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/migrations/jetbrains\#keyboard-shortcuts)

Cursor has a built-in keyboard shortcut manager that allows you to map your favorite keyboard shortcuts to actions.

With the [IntelliJ IDEA Keybindings](cursor:extension/k--kato.intellij-idea-keybindings) extension, you can bring almost all of the JetBrains IDEs shortcuts directly to Cursor!
Be sure to read the extension's documentation to learn how to configure it to your liking.

Common shortcuts that differ:

- **Find Action:** ⌘/Ctrl+Shift+P (vs. ⌘/Ctrl+Shift+A)
- **Quick Fix:** ⌘/Ctrl+. (vs. Alt+Enter)
- **Go to File:** ⌘/Ctrl+P (vs. ⌘/Ctrl+Shift+N)

### [Themes](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/migrations/jetbrains\#themes)

Recreate the look and feel of your favorite JetBrains IDEs in Cursor with these community themes.

Choose from the standard Darcula Theme, or pick a theme to match the syntax highlighting of your JetBrains tools.

- **[JetBrains - Darcula Theme](cursor:extension/rokoroku.vscode-theme-darcula)** \- Experience the classic JetBrains Darcula dark theme
- **[JetBrains PyCharm](cursor:extension/gabemahoney.pycharm-dark-theme-for-python)**
- **[IntelliJ](cursor:extension/compassak.intellij-idea-new-ui)**
- **[JetBrains Fleet](cursor:extension/MichaelZhou.fleet-theme)**
- **[JetBrains Rider](cursor:extension/muhammad-sammy.rider-theme)**
- **[JetBrains Icons](cursor:extension/ardonplay.vscode-jetbrains-icon-theme)** \- Get the familiar JetBrains file and folder icons

### [Font](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/migrations/jetbrains\#font)

To complete your JetBrains-like experience, you can use the official JetBrains Mono font:

1. [Download JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) and install it onto your system:
2. Restart Cursor after installing the font
3. Open Settings in Cursor (⌘/Ctrl + ,)
4. Search for "Font Family"
5. Set the font family to `'JetBrains Mono'`

For the best experience, you can also enable font ligatures by setting `"editor.fontLigatures": true` in your settings.

## [Tips for a Smooth Transition](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/migrations/jetbrains\#tips-for-a-smooth-transition)

1

### Use Command Palette

Press `⌘`/ `Ctrl` \+ `Shift` \+ `P` to find commands

2

### AI Features

Leverage Cursor's AI features for code completion and refactoring

3

### Customize Settings

Fine-tune your settings.json for optimal workflow

4

### Terminal Integration

Use the built-in terminal for command-line operations

5

### Extensions

Browse the VS Code marketplace for additional tools

Remember that while some workflows might be different, Cursor offers powerful AI-assisted coding features that can enhance your productivity beyond traditional IDE capabilities.

# Using Agent in CLI

## [Prompting](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/using\#prompting)

Stating intent clearly is recommended for the best results. For example, you can use the prompt "do not write any code" to ensure that the agent won't edit any files. This is generally helpful when planning tasks before implementing them.

Agent currently has tools for file operations, searching, and running shell commands. More tools are being added, similar to the IDE agent.

## [MCP](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/using\#mcp)

Agent supports [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://cursor.com/docs/context/mcp/directory) for extended functionality and integrations. The CLI will automatically detect and respect your `mcp.json` configuration file, enabling the same MCP servers and tools that you've configured for the IDE.

## [Rules](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/using\#rules)

The CLI agent supports the same [rules system](https://cursor.com/docs/context/rules) as the IDE. You can create rules in the `.cursor/rules` directory to provide context and guidance to the agent. These rules will be automatically loaded and applied based on their configuration, allowing you to customize the agent's behavior for different parts of your project or specific file types.

The CLI also reads `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` at the project root (if
present) and applies them as rules alongside `.cursor/rules`.

## [Working with Agent](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/using\#working-with-agent)

### [Navigation](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/using\#navigation)

Previous messages can be accessed using arrow up ( `ArrowUp`) where you can cycle through them.

### [Review](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/using\#review)

Review changes with `Ctrl+R`. Press `i` to add follow-up instructions. Use `ArrowUp`/ `ArrowDown` to scroll, and `ArrowLeft`/ `ArrowRight` to switch files.

### [Selecting context](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/using\#selecting-context)

Select files and folders to include in context with `@`. Free up space in the context window by running `/compress`. See [Summarization](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/chat/summarization) for details.

## [History](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/using\#history)

Continue from an existing thread with `--resume [thread id]` to load prior context.

To resume the most recent conversation, use `cursor-agent resume`.

You can also run `cursor-agent ls` to see a list of previous conversations.

## [Command approval](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/using\#command-approval)

Before running terminal commands, CLI will ask you to approve ( `y`) or reject ( `n`) execution.

## [Non-interactive mode](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/using\#non-interactive-mode)

Use `-p` or `--print` to run Agent in non-interactive mode. This will print the response to the console.

With non-interactive mode, you can invoke Agent in a non-interactive way. This allows you to integrate it in scripts, CI pipelines, etc.

You can combine this with `--output-format` to control how the output is formatted. For example, use `--output-format json` for structured output that's easier to parse in scripts, or `--output-format text` for plain text output of the agent's final response.

Cursor has full write access in non-interactive mode.

# Inline Edit

Inline Edit lets you edit code or ask questions directly in your editor with `Cmd+K`, which opens an input field where your selected code and instructions create your request.

![Inline Edit empty state](https://cursor.com/docs-static/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs-static%2Fimages%2Finline-edit%2Fempty.png&w=1920&q=75)

## [Modes](https://cursor.com/docs/inline-edit/overview\#modes)

### [Edit Selection](https://cursor.com/docs/inline-edit/overview\#edit-selection)

With code selected, `Cmd+K` edits that specific code based on your instructions.

![Inline Edit selection](https://cursor.com/docs-static/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs-static%2Fimages%2Finline-edit%2Fselection.png&w=1920&q=75)

Without selection, Cursor generates new code at your cursor position. The AI includes relevant surrounding code for context. For example, triggering on a function name includes the entire function.

### [Quick Question](https://cursor.com/docs/inline-edit/overview\#quick-question)

Press `Opt+Return` in the inline editor to ask questions about selected code.

After getting an answer, type "do it" or similar wording to convert the suggestion into code. This lets you explore ideas before implementing.

![Inline Edit quick question](https://cursor.com/docs-static/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs-static%2Fimages%2Finline-edit%2Fqq.png&w=1920&q=75)

### [Full File Edits](https://cursor.com/docs/inline-edit/overview\#full-file-edits)

For file-wide changes, use `Cmd+Shift+Return`. This mode enables comprehensive changes while maintaining control.

![Inline Edit full file](https://cursor.com/docs-static/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs-static%2Fimages%2Finline-edit%2Ffull-file.png&w=1920&q=75)

### [Send to Chat](https://cursor.com/docs/inline-edit/overview\#send-to-chat)

For multi-file edits or advanced features, use `Cmd+L` to send selected code to [Chat](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/modes#agent). This provides multi-file editing, detailed explanations, and advanced AI capabilities.

## [Follow-up instructions](https://cursor.com/docs/inline-edit/overview\#follow-up-instructions)

After each edit, refine results by adding instructions and pressing `Return`. The AI updates changes based on your feedback.

## [Default context](https://cursor.com/docs/inline-edit/overview\#default-context)

Inline Edit includes default context to improve code generation beyond any [@ symbols](https://cursor.com/docs/context/symbols/files-and-folders) you add.

This includes related files, recently viewed code, and relevant information. Cursor prioritizes the most relevant context for better results.

Reference

# Output Format

The Cursor Agent CLI provides multiple output formats with the `--output-format` option when combined with `--print`. These formats include structured formats for programmatic use ( `json`, `stream-json`) and a simplified text format for human-readable output ( `text`).

The default `--output-format` is `text`. This option is only valid when
printing ( `--print`) or when print mode is inferred (non-TTY stdout or piped
stdin).

## [JSON format](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/reference/output-format\#json-format)

The `json` output format emits a single JSON object (followed by a newline) when the run completes successfully. Deltas and tool events are not emitted; text is aggregated into the final result.

On failure, the process exits with a non-zero code and writes an error message to stderr. No well-formed JSON object is emitted in failure cases.

### [Success response](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/reference/output-format\#success-response)

When successful, the CLI outputs a JSON object with the following structure:

```
{
  "type": "result",
  "subtype": "success",
  "is_error": false,
  "duration_ms": 1234,
  "duration_api_ms": 1234,
  "result": "<full assistant text>",
  "session_id": "<uuid>",
  "request_id": "<optional request id>"
}
```

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `type` | Always `"result"` for terminal results |
| `subtype` | Always `"success"` for successful completions |
| `is_error` | Always `false` for successful responses |
| `duration_ms` | Total execution time in milliseconds |
| `duration_api_ms` | API request time in milliseconds (currently equal to `duration_ms`) |
| `result` | Complete assistant response text (concatenation of all text deltas) |
| `session_id` | Unique session identifier |
| `request_id` | Optional request identifier (may be omitted) |

## [Stream JSON format](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/reference/output-format\#stream-json-format)

The `stream-json` output format emits newline-delimited JSON (NDJSON). Each line contains a single JSON object representing an event during execution. This format aggregates text deltas and outputs **one line per assistant message** (the complete message between tool calls).

The stream ends with a terminal `result` event on success. On failure, the process exits with a non-zero code and the stream may end early without a terminal event; an error message is written to stderr.

**Streaming partial output:** For real-time character-level streaming, use `--stream-partial-output` with `--output-format stream-json`. This emits text as it's generated in small chunks, with the same event structure but multiple `assistant` events per message. Concatenate all `message.content[].text` values to reconstruct the complete response.

### [Event types](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/reference/output-format\#event-types)

#### [System initialization](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/reference/output-format\#system-initialization)

Emitted once at the beginning of each session:

```
{
  "type": "system",
  "subtype": "init",
  "apiKeySource": "env|flag|login",
  "cwd": "/absolute/path",
  "session_id": "<uuid>",
  "model": "<model display name>",
  "permissionMode": "default"
}
```

Future fields like `tools` and `mcp_servers` may be added to this event.

#### [User message](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/reference/output-format\#user-message)

Contains the user's input prompt:

```
{
  "type": "user",
  "message": {
    "role": "user",
    "content": [{ "type": "text", "text": "<prompt>" }]
  },
  "session_id": "<uuid>"
}
```

#### [Assistant message](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/reference/output-format\#assistant-message)

Emitted once per complete assistant message (between tool calls). Each event contains the full text of that message segment:

```
{
  "type": "assistant",
  "message": {
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": [{ "type": "text", "text": "<complete message text>" }]
  },
  "session_id": "<uuid>"
}
```

#### [Tool call events](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/reference/output-format\#tool-call-events)

Tool calls are tracked with start and completion events:

**Tool call started:**

```
{
  "type": "tool_call",
  "subtype": "started",
  "call_id": "<string id>",
  "tool_call": {
    "readToolCall": {
      "args": { "path": "file.txt" }
    }
  },
  "session_id": "<uuid>"
}
```

**Tool call completed:**

```
{
  "type": "tool_call",
  "subtype": "completed",
  "call_id": "<string id>",
  "tool_call": {
    "readToolCall": {
      "args": { "path": "file.txt" },
      "result": {
        "success": {
          "content": "file contents...",
          "isEmpty": false,
          "exceededLimit": false,
          "totalLines": 54,
          "totalChars": 1254
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "session_id": "<uuid>"
}
```

#### [Tool call types](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/reference/output-format\#tool-call-types)

**Read file tool:**

- **Started**: `tool_call.readToolCall.args` contains `{ "path": "file.txt" }`
- **Completed**: `tool_call.readToolCall.result.success` contains file metadata and content

**Write file tool:**

- **Started**: `tool_call.writeToolCall.args` contains `{ "path": "file.txt", "fileText": "content...", "toolCallId": "id" }`
- **Completed**: `tool_call.writeToolCall.result.success` contains `{ "path": "/absolute/path", "linesCreated": 19, "fileSize": 942 }`

**Other tools:**

- May use `tool_call.function` structure with `{ "name": "tool_name", "arguments": "..." }`

#### [Terminal result](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/reference/output-format\#terminal-result)

The final event emitted on successful completion:

```
{
  "type": "result",
  "subtype": "success",
  "duration_ms": 1234,
  "duration_api_ms": 1234,
  "is_error": false,
  "result": "<full assistant text>",
  "session_id": "<uuid>",
  "request_id": "<optional request id>"
}
```

### [Example sequence](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/reference/output-format\#example-sequence)

Here's a representative NDJSON sequence showing the typical flow of events:

```

{"type":"assistant","message":{"role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"text","text":"Done! I've created the summary in summary.txt"}]},"session_id":"c6b62c6f-7ead-4fd6-9922-e952131177ff"}
{"type":"result","subtype":"success","duration_ms":5234,"duration_api_ms":5234,"is_error":false,"result":"I'll read the README.md fileBased on the README, I'll create a summaryDone! I've created the summary in summary.txt","session_id":"c6b62c6f-7ead-4fd6-9922-e952131177ff","request_id":"10e11780-df2f-45dc-a1ff-4540af32e9c0"}
```

## [Text format](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/reference/output-format\#text-format)

The `text` output format provides only the final assistant message without any intermediate progress updates or tool call summaries. This is the cleanest output format for scripts that only need the agent's final response.

This format is ideal when you want just the answer or final message from the agent, without any progress indicators or tool execution details.

### [Example output](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/reference/output-format\#example-output)

```rounded-sm border border-border bg-card/80 p-1 font-mono text-xs
The command to move this branch onto main is `git rebase --onto main HEAD~3`.

```

Only the final assistant message (after the last tool call) is output, with no tool call summaries or intermediate text.

## [Implementation notes](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/reference/output-format\#implementation-notes)

- Each event is emitted as a single line terminated by `\n`
- `thinking` events are suppressed in print mode and will not appear in any output format
- Field additions may occur over time in a backward-compatible way (consumers should ignore unknown fields)
- The `json` format waits for completion before outputting results
- The `stream-json` format outputs complete agent messages
- The `--stream-partial-output` flag provides real-time text deltas for character-level streaming (only works with `stream-json` format)
- Tool call IDs can be used to correlate start/completion events
- Session IDs remain consistent throughout a single agent execution

# @ Symbols

Navigate suggestions using arrow keys. Press `Enter` to select. If the suggestion is a category like `Files`, the suggestions filter to show the most relevant items within that category.

![Context menu](https://cursor.com/docs-static/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs-static%2Fimages%2Fcontext%2Fsymbols%2Fcontext-menu.png&w=1920&q=75)

## [@Files & Folders](https://cursor.com/docs/context/symbols\#files-folders)

### [Referencing Files](https://cursor.com/docs/context/symbols\#referencing-files)

Reference entire files in Chat and Inline Edit by selecting `@Files & Folders` followed by the filename to search. You can also drag files from the sidebar directly into Agent to add as context.

![@Files & Folders symbol](https://cursor.com/docs-static/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs-static%2Fimages%2Fcontext%2Fsymbols%2F%40-files-folders.png&w=1920&q=75)

### [Referencing Folders](https://cursor.com/docs/context/symbols\#referencing-folders)

When referencing folders using `@Folders`, Cursor provides the folder path and overview of its contents to help the AI understand what's available.

After selecting a folder, type `/` to navigate deeper and see all subfolders.

![@Folders symbol](https://cursor.com/docs-static/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs-static%2Fimages%2Fcontext%2Fsymbols%2F%40-folders.png&w=1920&q=75)

#### [Full folder content](https://cursor.com/docs/context/symbols\#full-folder-content)

Enable **Full Folder Content** in settings. When enabled, Cursor attempts to include all files from the folder in the context.

![Folder setting](https://cursor.com/docs-static/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs-static%2Fimages%2Fcontext%2Fsymbols%2Ffolder-setting.png&w=1920&q=75)

For large folders exceeding the context window, an outline view appears with a tooltip showing how many files were included while Cursor manages the available context space.

Using full folder content with [Max mode enabled](https://cursor.com/docs/context/max-mode)
significantly increases request costs as more input tokens are consumed.

### [Context management](https://cursor.com/docs/context/symbols\#context-management)

Large files and folders are automatically condensed to fit within context limits. See [file & folder condensation](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/chat/summarization#file--folder-condensation) for details.

## [@Definitions](https://cursor.com/docs/context/symbols\#definitions)

This feature is only available in [Inline Edit](https://cursor.com/docs/inline-edit/overview).

The `@Definitions` symbol automatically includes relevant code definitions from your codebase as context.

![@Definitions symbol](https://cursor.com/docs-static/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs-static%2Fimages%2Fcontext%2Fsymbols%2F%40-definitions.png&w=1920&q=75)

## [@Code](https://cursor.com/docs/context/symbols\#code)

Reference specific code sections using the `@Code` symbol. This provides more granular control than `@Files & Folders`, letting you select precise code snippets instead of entire files.

![@Git symbol](https://cursor.com/docs-static/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs-static%2Fimages%2Fcontext%2Fsymbols%2F%40-git.png&w=1920&q=75)

- `@Commit`: Reference current working state changes compared to the last commit. Shows all modified, added, and deleted files not yet committed.
- `@Branch`: Compare your current branch's changes with the main branch. Shows all commits and changes in your branch but not in main.

## [@Past Chats](https://cursor.com/docs/context/symbols\#past-chats)

When working on complex tasks in [Chat](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/overview), you might need to reference context or decisions from previous conversations. The `@Past Chats` symbol includes summarized versions of previous chats as context.

Particularly useful when:

- You have a long Chat session with important context to reference
- You're starting a new related task and want continuity
- You want to share reasoning or decisions from a previous session

![@Past Chats symbol](https://cursor.com/docs-static/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs-static%2Fimages%2Fcontext%2Fsymbols%2F%40-past-chats.png&w=1920&q=75)

## [@Cursor Rules](https://cursor.com/docs/context/symbols\#cursor-rules)

The `@Cursor Rules` symbol provides access to [project rules](https://cursor.com/docs/context/rules) and guidelines you've set up, letting you explicitly apply them to your context.

![@Cursor Rules symbol](https://cursor.com/docs-static/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs-static%2Fimages%2Fcontext%2Fsymbols%2F%40-rules.png&w=1920&q=75)

## [@Web](https://cursor.com/docs/context/symbols\#web)

With `@Web`, Cursor searches the web using [exa.ai](https://exa.ai/) to find up-to-date information and add it as context. This includes the ability to parse PDF files from direct links.

Web search is disabled by default. Enable it in Settings → Features → Web
Search.

![Web search symbol](https://cursor.com/docs-static/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs-static%2Fimages%2Fcontext%2Fsymbols%2F%40-web.png&w=1920&q=75)

## [@Link](https://cursor.com/docs/context/symbols\#link)

When you paste a URL in Chat, Cursor automatically tags it as an `@Link` and fetches the content to use as context. This includes support for PDF documents - Cursor extracts and parses text content from any publicly accessible PDF URL.

![Link context symbol](https://cursor.com/docs-static/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs-static%2Fimages%2Fcontext%2Fsymbols%2F%40-link.png&w=1920&q=75)

### [Unlink](https://cursor.com/docs/context/symbols\#unlink)

To use a URL as plain text without fetching its content:

- Click the tagged link and select `Unlink`
- Or paste while holding `Shift` to prevent automatic tagging

![Link context menu](https://cursor.com/docs-static/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs-static%2Fimages%2Fcontext%2Fsymbols%2F%40-link-menu.png&w=1920&q=75)

## [@Recent Changes](https://cursor.com/docs/context/symbols\#recent-changes)

The `@Recent Changes` symbol includes recent code modifications as context in AI conversations.

- Changes are chronologically ordered
- Prioritizes the last 10 changes
- Respects `.cursorignore` settings

![@Recent Changes symbol](https://cursor.com/docs-static/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs-static%2Fimages%2Fcontext%2Fsymbols%2F%40-recent-changes.png&w=1920&q=75)

## [@Linter Errors](https://cursor.com/docs/context/symbols\#linter-errors)

`@Linter Errors` symbol automatically captures and provides context about linting errors and warnings from your currently active file. [Agent](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/overview) can see lint errors by default.

For linter errors to be visible, you need the appropriate language server
installed and configured for your programming language. Cursor automatically
detects and uses installed language servers, but you may need to install
additional extensions or tools for specific languages.

![@Linter Errors symbol](https://cursor.com/docs-static/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs-static%2Fimages%2Fcontext%2Fsymbols%2F%40-linter-errors.png&w=1920&q=75)

## [\#Files](https://cursor.com/docs/context/symbols\#files)

Use `#` followed by a filename to focus on specific files. Combine with `@` symbols for precise context control.

# Checkpoints

Checkpoints are automatic snapshots of Agent's changes to your codebase. They let you undo Agent modifications if needed.

## [Restoring checkpoints](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/chat/checkpoints\#restoring-checkpoints)

Two ways to restore:

1. **From input box**: Click `Restore Checkpoint` button on previous requests
2. **From message**: Click the + button when hovering over a message

Checkpoints are not version control. Use Git for permanent history.

## [How they work](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/chat/checkpoints\#how-they-work)

- Stored locally, separate from Git
- Track only Agent changes (not manual edits)
- Cleaned up automatically

Manual edits aren't tracked. Only use checkpoints for Agent changes.

## [FAQ](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/chat/checkpoints\#faq)

### Do checkpoints affect Git?

### How long are they kept?

### Can I create them manually?

# JavaScript & TypeScript

Welcome to JavaScript and TypeScript development in Cursor! The editor provides exceptional support for JS/TS development through its extension ecosystem. Here's what you need to know to get the most out of Cursor.

## [Essential Extensions](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/languages/javascript-typescript\#essential-extensions)

While Cursor works great with any extensions you prefer, we recommend these for those just getting started:

- **ESLint** \- Required for Cursor's AI-powered lint fixing capabilities
- **JavaScript and TypeScript Language Features** \- Enhanced language support and IntelliSense
- **Path Intellisense** \- Intelligent path completion for file paths

## [Cursor Features](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/languages/javascript-typescript\#cursor-features)

Cursor enhances your existing JavaScript/TypeScript workflow with:

- **Tab Completions**: Context-aware code completions that understand your project structure
- **Automatic Imports**: Tab can automatically import libraries as soon as you use them
- **Inline Editing**: Use `CMD+K` on any line to edit with perfect syntax
- **Composer Guidance**: Plan and edit your code across multiple files with the Composer

### [Automatic Linting Resolution](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/languages/javascript-typescript\#automatic-linting-resolution)

One of Cursor's standout features is its seamless integration with Linter extensions.
Ensure you have a linter, like ESLint, setup, and enable the 'Iterate on Lints' setting.

Then, when using the Agent mode in Composer, once the AI has attempted to answer your query, and has made any code changes, it will automatically read the output of the linter and will attempt to fix any lint errors it might not have known about.

## [Framework Support](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/languages/javascript-typescript\#framework-support)

Cursor works seamlessly with all major JavaScript frameworks and libraries, such as:

### [React & Next.js](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/languages/javascript-typescript\#react-nextjs)

- Full JSX/TSX support with intelligent component suggestions
- Server component and API route intelligence for Next.js
- Recommended: [**React Developer Tools**](cursor:extension/msjsdiag.vscode-react-native) extension

### [Vue.js](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/languages/javascript-typescript\#vuejs)

- Template syntax support with Volar integration
- Component auto-completion and type checking
- Recommended: [**Vue Language Features**](cursor:extension/vue.volar)

### [Angular](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/languages/javascript-typescript\#angular)

- Template validation and TypeScript decorator support
- Component and service generation
- Recommended: [**Angular Language Service**](cursor:extension/Angular.ng-template)

### [Svelte](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/languages/javascript-typescript\#svelte)

- Component syntax highlighting and intelligent completions
- Reactive statement and store suggestions
- Recommended: [**Svelte for VS Code**](cursor:extension/svelte.svelte-vscode)

### [Backend Frameworks (Express/NestJS)](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/languages/javascript-typescript\#backend-frameworks-expressnestjs)

- Route and middleware intelligence
- TypeScript decorator support for NestJS
- API testing tools integration

Remember, Cursor's AI features work well with all these frameworks, understanding their patterns and best practices to provide relevant suggestions. The AI can help with everything from component creation to complex refactoring tasks, while respecting your project's existing patterns.

# SCIM

## [Overview](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/scim\#overview)

SCIM 2.0 provisioning automatically manages your team members and directory groups through your identity provider. Available on [Enterprise](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise) plans with SSO enabled.

## [Prerequisites](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/scim\#prerequisites)

- Cursor [Enterprise plan](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise)
- SSO must be configured first - **SCIM requires an active SSO connection**
- Admin access to your identity provider (Okta, Azure AD, etc.)
- Admin access to your Cursor organization

## [How it works](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/scim\#how-it-works)

### [User provisioning](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/scim\#user-provisioning)

Users are automatically added to Cursor when assigned to the SCIM application in your identity provider. When unassigned, they're removed. Changes sync in real-time.

### [Directory groups](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/scim\#directory-groups)

Directory groups and their membership sync from your identity provider. Group and user management must be done through your identity provider - Cursor displays this information as read-only.

### [Spend management](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/scim\#spend-management)

Set different per-user spend limits for each directory group. Directory group limits take precedence over team-level limits. Users in multiple groups receive the highest applicable spend limit.

## [Setup](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/scim\#setup)

1

### Ensure SSO is configured

SCIM requires SSO to be set up first. If you haven't configured SSO yet,
follow the [SSO setup guide](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/sso) before proceeding.

2

### Access Active Directory Management

Navigate to
[cursor.com/dashboard?tab=active-directory](https://www.cursor.com/dashboard?tab=active-directory)
with an admin account, or go to your dashboard settings and select the "Active
Directory Management" tab.

3

### Start SCIM setup

Once SSO is verified, you'll see a link for step-by-step SCIM setup. Click
this to begin the configuration wizard.

4

### Configure SCIM in your identity provider

In your identity provider: - Create or configure your SCIM application - Use
the SCIM endpoint and token provided by Cursor - Enable user and push group
provisioning - Test the connection

5

### Configure spend limits (optional)

Back in Cursor's Active Directory Management page: - View your synchronized
directory groups - Set per-user spend limits for specific groups as needed -
Review which limits apply to users in multiple groups

### [Identity provider setup](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/scim\#identity-provider-setup)

For provider-specific setup instructions:

[Identity Provider Guides\\
\\
Setup instructions for Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace, and more.](https://workos.com/docs/integrations)

## [Managing users and groups](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/scim\#managing-users-and-groups)

All user and group management must be done through your identity provider.
Changes made in your identity provider will automatically sync to Cursor, but
you cannot modify users or groups directly in Cursor.

### [User management](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/scim\#user-management)

- Add users by assigning them to your SCIM application in your identity provider
- Remove users by unassigning them from the SCIM application
- User profile changes (name, email) sync automatically from your identity provider

### [Group management](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/scim\#group-management)

- Directory groups are automatically synced from your identity provider
- Group membership changes are reflected in real-time
- Use groups to organize users and set different spend limits

### [Spend limits](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/scim\#spend-limits)

- Set different per-user limits for each directory group
- Users inherit the highest spend limit from their groups
- Group limits override the default team-wide per-user limit

## [FAQ](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/scim\#faq)

### [Why isn't SCIM management showing up in my dashboard?](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/scim\#why-isnt-scim-management-showing-up-in-my-dashboard)

Ensure SSO is properly configured and working before setting up SCIM. SCIM requires an active SSO connection to function.

### [Why aren't users syncing?](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/scim\#why-arent-users-syncing)

Verify that users are assigned to the SCIM application in your identity provider. Users must be explicitly assigned to appear in Cursor.

### [Why aren't groups appearing?](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/scim\#why-arent-groups-appearing)

Check that push group provisioning is enabled in your identity provider's SCIM settings. Group sync must be configured separately from user sync.

### [Why aren't spend limits applying?](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/scim\#why-arent-spend-limits-applying)

Confirm users are properly assigned to the expected groups in your identity provider. Group membership determines which spend limits apply.

### [Can I manage SCIM users and groups directly in Cursor?](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/scim\#can-i-manage-scim-users-and-groups-directly-in-cursor)

No. All user and group management must be done through your identity provider. Cursor displays this information as read-only.

### [How quickly do changes sync?](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/scim\#how-quickly-do-changes-sync)

Changes made in your identity provider sync to Cursor in real-time. There may be a brief delay for large bulk operations.

# Commands

Custom commands allow you to create reusable workflows that can be triggered with a simple `/` prefix in the chat input box. These commands help standardize processes across your team and make common tasks more efficient.

![Commands input example](https://cursor.com/docs-static/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs-static%2Fimages%2Fchat%2Fcommands%2Finput.png&w=1920&q=75)

Commands are currently in beta. The feature and syntax may change as we continue to improve it.

## [How commands work](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/chat/commands\#how-commands-work)

Commands are defined as plain Markdown files that can be stored in three locations:

1. **Project commands**: Stored in the `.cursor/commands` directory of your project
2. **Global commands**: Stored in the `~/.cursor/commands` directory in your home directory
3. **Team commands**: Created by team admins in the [Cursor Dashboard](https://cursor.com/dashboard?tab=team-content&section=commands) and automatically available to all team members

When you type `/` in the chat input box, Cursor will automatically detect and display available commands from all locations, making them instantly accessible across your workflow.

## [Creating commands](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/chat/commands\#creating-commands)

1. Create a `.cursor/commands` directory in your project root
2. Add `.md` files with descriptive names (e.g., `review-code.md`, `write-tests.md`)
3. Write plain Markdown content describing what the command should do
4. Commands will automatically appear in the chat when you type `/`

Here's an example of how your commands directory structure might look:

```
.cursor/
└── commands/
    ├── address-github-pr-comments.md
    ├── code-review-checklist.md
    ├── create-pr.md
    ├── light-review-existing-diffs.md
    ├── onboard-new-developer.md
    ├── run-all-tests-and-fix.md
    ├── security-audit.md
    └── setup-new-feature.md
```

## [Team commands](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/chat/commands\#team-commands)

Team commands are available on Team and Enterprise plans.

Team admins can create server-enforced custom commands that are automatically available to all team members. This makes it easy to share standardized prompts and workflows across your entire organization.

### [Creating team commands](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/chat/commands\#creating-team-commands)

1. Navigate to the [Team Content dashboard](https://cursor.com/dashboard?tab=team-content&section=commands)
2. Click to create a new command
3. Provide:
   - **Name**: The command name that will appear after the `/` prefix
   - **Description** (optional): Helpful context about what the command does
   - **Content**: The Markdown content that defines the command's behavior
4. Save the command

Once created, team commands are immediately available to all team members when they type `/` in the chat input box. Team members don't need to manually sync or download anything - the commands are automatically synchronized.

### [Benefits of team commands](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/chat/commands\#benefits-of-team-commands)

- **Centralized management**: Update commands once and changes are instantly available to all team members
- **Standardization**: Ensure everyone uses consistent workflows and best practices
- **Easy sharing**: No need to distribute files or coordinate updates across the team
- **Access control**: Only team admins can create and modify team commands

## [Parameters](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/chat/commands\#parameters)

You can provide additional context to a command in the Agent chat input. Anything you type after the command name is included in the model prompt alongside your provided input. For example:

```
/commit and /pr these changes to address DX-523
```

## [Examples](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/chat/commands\#examples)

Try these commands in your projects to get a feel for how they work.

# Identity and Access Management

Identity and access management controls who can use Cursor in your organization and what they can do. You'll set up authentication, automate user provisioning, and enforce policies through device management.

We recommend implementing identity controls in this order:

1. **Set up SSO**: Get centralized authentication working first
2. **Enable SCIM**: Automate user lifecycle management
3. **Deploy MDM policies**: Enforce allowed team IDs and extensions
4. **Assign roles**: Grant admin access to the right people

## [Single Sign-On (SSO) and SAML](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/identity-and-access-management\#single-sign-on-sso-and-saml)

SSO lets your users authenticate to Cursor using your existing identity provider. Instead of creating separate Cursor passwords, users log in with their corporate credentials.

Cursor supports SAML 2.0 integration with providers like Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace, and OneLogin. When you enable SSO, you can require it for all team members, preventing password-based authentication entirely.

See [SSO and SAML setup](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/sso) for detailed configuration instructions.

## [SCIM provisioning](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/identity-and-access-management\#scim-provisioning)

SCIM 2.0 provisioning automatically manages your team members and directory groups through your identity provider. Available on Enterprise plans with SSO enabled.

Without SCIM, you need to manually add users to your Cursor team and remove them when they leave. With SCIM:

- New employees get Cursor access automatically when added to the right group
- Departing employees lose access when removed from your IDP
- Group membership changes propagate automatically

See [SCIM provisioning](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/scim) for setup instructions.

## [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/identity-and-access-management\#role-based-access-control-rbac)

Cursor teams have three roles: Members, Admins, and Unpaid Admins.

See [Members & Roles](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/members) for more information.

## [MDM policies](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/identity-and-access-management\#mdm-policies)

Mobile Device Management (MDM) systems let you enforce policies on user devices. Cursor supports MDM-based policies on macOS and Windows to ensure users comply with organizational requirements.

See [Deployment Patterns](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/deployment-patterns#mdm-configuration) for platform-specific MDM configuration instructions.

### [Allowed Team IDs](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/identity-and-access-management\#allowed-team-ids)

The most important MDM policy prevents users from logging into personal Cursor accounts on corporate devices.

When you set an allowed team ID policy, Cursor only permits authentication to those specific team IDs. If a user tries to log in with a different team ID (like a personal account), Cursor logs them out immediately.

For example, if your employees have corporate laptops, you can set the allowed team ID to your enterprise team ID. This prevents them from accidentally using personal accounts that might not have Privacy Mode enabled.

The `cursorAuth.allowedTeamId` Cursor setting controls which team IDs are permitted to log into Cursor. This setting accepts a comma-separated list of team IDs that are authorized for access.

For example, setting `cursorAuth.allowedTeamId` to `"1,3,7"` allows users from those specific team IDs to log in.

When a user attempts to log in with a team ID that is not in the allowed list:

- They are forcefully logged out immediately
- An error message is displayed
- The application prevents further authentication attempts until a valid team ID is used

To centrally manage allowed team IDs for your organization, configure the `AllowedTeamId` policy using your device management solution. This policy overrides the `cursorAuth.allowedTeamId` setting on users' devices. The value of this policy is a string containing the comma-separated list of authorized team IDs.

See [Deployment Patterns](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/deployment-patterns#mdm-configuration) for platform-specific MDM configuration instructions.

### [Allowed Extensions](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/identity-and-access-management\#allowed-extensions)

Control which extensions users can install in Cursor. Extensions can access your workspace, so you want to ensure only trusted extensions run.

**How it works:**

The `extensions.allowed` Cursor setting controls which extensions can be installed. This setting accepts a JSON object where keys are publisher names and values are booleans indicating whether extensions from that publisher are allowed.

For example, setting `extensions.allowed` to `{"anysphere": true, "github": true}` allows extensions from Anysphere and GitHub publishers, while setting it to `{"anysphere": false}` blocks Anysphere extensions.

You can be more specific by including the full extension ID:

```
{
  "anysphere": true,
  "github": true,
  "ms-azuretools.vscode-docker": true
}
```

This allows extensions from Anysphere, GitHub, and Microsoft while blocking all others.

To centrally manage allowed extensions for your organization, configure the `AllowedExtensions` policy using your device management solution. This policy overrides the `extensions.allowed` setting on users' devices. The value of this policy is a JSON string that defines the allowed publishers.

See [Deployment Patterns](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/deployment-patterns#mdm-configuration) for platform-specific MDM configuration instructions.

### [The .cursor folder](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/identity-and-access-management\#the-cursor-folder)

When you open a project in Cursor, the IDE creates a `.cursor` folder at the root of your repository. This folder contains:

- Project-specific settings
- Indexing cache
- Project rules and context

This folder can be checked into source control. Your team members benefit from shared rules and settings, but be aware that these configurations are visible to anyone with repository access.

For repositories you don't control access to, review the `.cursor` folder contents before committing. Don't put sensitive information in rules files.

You can also manage rules and commands through the server on the [team dashboard](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/dashboard).

### [Workspace Trust](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/identity-and-access-management\#workspace-trust)

Cursor supports [workspace trust](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editing/workspaces/workspace-trust), but it's disabled by default. When enabled, it prompts you to choose between normal or restricted mode for new workspaces. Restricted mode breaks AI features. For untrusted repos, use a basic text editor instead.

To enable Workspace Trust for your organization, configure the `WorkspaceTrustEnabled` policy using your device management solution. This policy overrides the `security.workspace.trust.enabled` setting on users' devices. Set the value to `true` to enable Workspace Trust.

See [Deployment Patterns](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/deployment-patterns#mdm-configuration) for platform-specific MDM configuration instructions.

To enable workspace trust:

1. Open your user settings.json file

2. Add the following configuration:















```
"security.workspace.trust.enabled": true
```


See [Deployment Patterns](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/deployment-patterns#mdm-configuration) for platform-specific MDM configuration instructions.

# Tab

Tab is a specialized Cursor model for autocompletion. The more you use it, the better it becomes as you inject intent by accepting `Tab` or rejecting `Escape` suggestions. With Tab, you can:

- Modify multiple lines at once
- Add import statements when missing
- Jump within and across files for coordinated edits
- Get suggestions based on recent changes, linter errors and accepted edits

## [Suggestions](https://cursor.com/docs/tab/overview\#suggestions)

When adding text, completions appear as semi-opaque ghost text. When modifying existing code, it shows as a diff popup right of your current line.

![Tab inline suggestion](https://cursor.com/docs-static/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs-static%2Fimages%2Ftab%2Ftab-inline.png&w=1920&q=75)![Tab block suggestion](https://cursor.com/docs-static/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs-static%2Fimages%2Ftab%2Ftab-block.png&w=1920&q=75)

Accept suggestions with `Tab`, reject with `Escape`, or accept word-by-word using `Cmd+Arrow Right`. Keep typing or press `Escape` to hide suggestions.

### [Jump in file](https://cursor.com/docs/tab/overview\#jump-in-file)

Tab predicts your next editing location in the file and suggests jumps. After accepting an edit, press `Tab` again to jump to the next location.

![Jump in file](https://cursor.com/docs-static/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs-static%2Fimages%2Ftab%2Fjump-in-file.png&w=1920&q=75)

### [Jump across files](https://cursor.com/docs/tab/overview\#jump-across-files)

Tab predicts context-aware edits across files. A portal window appears at the bottom when a cross-file jump is suggested.

![Jump to file](https://cursor.com/docs-static/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs-static%2Fimages%2Ftab%2Fjump-to-file.png&w=1920&q=75)

### [Auto-import](https://cursor.com/docs/tab/overview\#auto-import)

In TypeScript and Python, Tab automatically adds import statements when missing. Use a method from another file and Tab suggests the import. Accepting adds it without disrupting your flow.

If auto-import isn't working:

- Ensure your project has the right language server or extensions
- Test with `Cmd .` to check if the import appears in _Quick Fix_ suggestions

![Auto import](https://cursor.com/docs-static/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs-static%2Fimages%2Ftab%2Fauto-import.png&w=1920&q=75)

### [Tab in Peek](https://cursor.com/docs/tab/overview\#tab-in-peek)

Tab works in _Go to Definition_ or _Go to Type Definition_ peek views. Useful for modifying function signatures and fixing call sites.

![Tab in Peek](https://cursor.com/docs-static/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs-static%2Fimages%2Ftab%2Ftab-in-peek.png&w=1920&q=75)

# Mermaid Diagrams

Architectural diagrams help you make sense of how your system works. You can use them to explore logic, track data, and communicate structure. Cursor supports generating these diagrams directly using tools like Mermaid, so you can go from code to visual in just a few prompts.

![Example of an architectural diagram](https://cursor.com/docs-static/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs-static%2Fimages%2Fguides%2Ftutorials%2Farchitectural-diagrams%2Fpostgres-flowchart.png&w=1920&q=75)

## [Why diagrams matter](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/tools/mermaid-diagrams\#why-diagrams-matter)

Diagrams clarify how data flows and how components interact. They're useful when you:

- Want to understand flow control in your codebase
- Need to trace data lineage from input to output
- Are onboarding others or documenting your system

They're also great for debugging and asking smarter questions. Visuals help you (and the model) see the bigger picture.

## [Two dimensions to consider](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/tools/mermaid-diagrams\#two-dimensions-to-consider)

There are a few different angles to think about:

- **Purpose**: Are you mapping logic, data flow, infrastructure, or something else?
- **Format**: Do you want something quick (like a Mermaid diagram) or formal (like UML)?

## [How to prompt](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/tools/mermaid-diagrams\#how-to-prompt)

Start with a clear goal. Here are some common ways to ask:

- **Flow control**: "Show me how requests go from the controller to the database."
- **Data lineage**: "Trace this variable from where it enters to where it ends up."
- **Structure**: "Give me a component-level view of this service."

You can include start and end points, or ask Cursor to find the full path.

## [Working with Mermaid](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/tools/mermaid-diagrams\#working-with-mermaid)

Mermaid is simple to learn and renders directly in Markdown (with the right extension). Cursor can generate diagrams like:

- `flowchart` for logic and sequences
- `sequenceDiagram` for interactions
- `classDiagram` for object structure
- `graph TD` for simple directional maps

Failed to render diagram: Unsupported color format: ""

You can install the [Mermaid extension](https://marketplace.cursorapi.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-mermaid) to preview diagrams.

1. Go to Extensions tab
2. Search for Mermaid and install the extension

## [Diagram strategy](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/tools/mermaid-diagrams\#diagram-strategy)

Start small. Don't aim to map everything at once.

- Pick one function, route, or process
- Ask Cursor to diagram that part using Mermaid
- Once you have a few, ask it to combine them

This mirrors the **C4 model** – where you start at a low level (code or components) and work upward to higher-level overviews.

### [Recommended flow](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/tools/mermaid-diagrams\#recommended-flow)

1. Start with a detailed, low-level diagram
2. Summarize it into a mid-level view
3. Repeat until you reach the level of abstraction you want
4. Ask Cursor to merge them into a single diagram or system map

Failed to render diagram: Unsupported color format: ""

## [Takeaways](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/tools/mermaid-diagrams\#takeaways)

- Use diagrams to understand flow, logic, and data
- Start with small prompts and grow your diagram from there
- Mermaid is the easiest format to work with in Cursor
- Start low-level and abstract upward, just like in the C4 model
- Cursor can help you generate, refine, and combine diagrams with ease

# Modes

Agent offers different modes optimized for specific tasks. Each mode has different capabilities and tools enabled to match your workflow needs.

Understanding [how agents work](https://cursor.com/learn/agents) and [tool calling fundamentals](https://cursor.com/learn/tool-calling) will help you choose the right mode for your task.

| Mode | For | Capabilities | Tools |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **[Agent](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/modes#agent)** | Complex features, refactoring | Autonomous exploration, multi-file edits | All tools enabled |
| **[Ask](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/modes#ask)** | Learning, planning, questions | Read-only exploration, no automatic changes | Search tools only |
| **[Plan](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/modes#plan)** | Complex features requiring planning | Creates detailed plans before execution, asks clarifying questions | All tools enabled |
| **[Custom](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/modes#custom)** | Specialized workflows | User-defined capabilities | Configurable |

## [Agent](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/modes\#agent)

The default mode for complex coding tasks. Agent autonomously explores your codebase, edits multiple files, runs commands, and fixes errors to complete your requests.

![Agent mode](https://cursor.com/docs-static/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs-static%2Fimages%2Fchat%2Fagent.png&w=1920&q=75)

## [Ask](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/modes\#ask)

Read-only mode for learning and exploration. Ask searches your codebase and provides answers without making any changes - perfect for understanding code before modifying it.

![Ask mode](https://cursor.com/docs-static/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs-static%2Fimages%2Fchat%2Fask.png&w=1920&q=75)

## [Plan](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/modes\#plan)

Plan Mode creates detailed implementation plans before writing any code. Agent researches your codebase, asks clarifying questions, and generates a reviewable plan you can edit before building.

Press `Shift+Tab` from the chat input to rotate to Plan Mode. Cursor also suggests it automatically when you type keywords that indicate complex tasks.

### [How it works](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/modes\#how-it-works)

1. Agent asks clarifying questions to understand your requirements
2. Researches your codebase to gather relevant context
3. Creates a comprehensive implementation plan
4. You review and edit the plan through chat or markdown files
5. Click to build the plan when ready

Plans open as ephemeral virtual files that you can view and edit. To save a plan to your workspace, click "Save to workspace" to store it in `.cursor/plans/` for future reference, team sharing, and documentation.

## [Custom](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/modes\#custom)

Create your own modes with specific tool combinations and instructions. Mix and match capabilities to fit your workflow.

Custom modes are in beta. Enable them in `Cursor Settings` → `Chat` → `Custom   Modes`

### [Examples](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/modes\#examples)

### Learn

### Refactor

### Debug

## [Switching modes](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/modes\#switching-modes)

- Use the mode picker dropdown in Agent
- Press `Cmd+.` for quick switching
- Set keyboard shortcuts in [settings](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/modes#settings)

## [Settings](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/modes\#settings)

All modes share common configuration options:

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Model | Choose which AI model to use |
| Keyboard shortcuts | Set shortcuts to switch between modes |

Mode-specific settings:

| Mode | Settings | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Agent** | Auto-run and Auto-fix Errors | Automatically run commands and fix errors |
| **Ask** | Search Codebase | Automatically find relevant files |
| **Custom** | Tool selection & Instructions | Configure [tools](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/tools) and custom prompts |

# Pricing

You can try Cursor for free or purchase an individual or team plan.

## [Individual](https://cursor.com/docs/account/pricing\#individual)

All individual plans include:

- Unlimited tab completions
- Extended agent usage limits on all models
- Access to Bugbot
- Access to Background Agents

Each plan includes usage charged at model inference [API prices](https://cursor.com/docs/models#model-pricing):

- Pro includes $20 of API agent usage + additional bonus usage
- Pro Plus includes $70 of API agent usage + additional bonus usage
- Ultra includes $400 of API agent usage + additional bonus usage

We work hard to grant additional bonus capacity beyond the guaranteed included usage. Since different models have different API costs, your model selection affects token output and how quickly your included usage is consumed. You can view usage and token breakdowns on [your dashboard](https://cursor.com/dashboard?tab=usage). Limit notifications are routinely shown in the editor.

To understand how usage is calculated, see our guide on [tokens and pricing](https://cursor.com/learn/tokens-pricing).

### [How much usage do I need?](https://cursor.com/docs/account/pricing\#how-much-usage-do-i-need)

Based on our usage data, you can expect the following usage levels:

- **Daily Tab users**: Always stay within $20
- **Limited Agent users**: Often stay within the included $20
- **Daily Agent users**: Typically $60–$100/mo total usage
- **Power users (multiple agents/automation)**: Often $200+/mo total usage

Based on our usage data, limits are roughly equivalent to the following for a _median user_:

- Pro: ~225 Sonnet 4.5 requests, ~550 Gemini requests, or ~500 GPT 5 requests
- Pro+: ~675 Sonnet 4.5 requests, ~1,650 Gemini requests, or ~1,500 GPT 5 requests
- Ultra: ~4,500 Sonnet 4.5 requests, ~11,000 Gemini requests, or ~10,000 GPT 5 requests

### [What happens when I reach my limit?](https://cursor.com/docs/account/pricing\#what-happens-when-i-reach-my-limit)

When you exceed your included monthly usage, you'll be notified in the editor and can choose to:

- **Add on-demand usage**: Continue using Cursor at the same API rates with pay-as-you-go billing
- **Upgrade your plan**: Move to a higher tier for more included usage

On-demand usage is billed monthly at the same rates as your included usage. Requests are never downgraded in quality or speed.

## [Teams](https://cursor.com/docs/account/pricing\#teams)

There are two teams plans: Teams ($40/user/mo) and Enterprise (Custom).

Team plans provide additional features like:

- Privacy Mode enforcement
- Admin Dashboard with usage stats
- Centralized team billing
- SAML/OIDC SSO

We recommend Teams for any customer that is happy self-serving. We recommend [Enterprise](https://cursor.com/contact-sales) for customers that need priority support, pooled usage, invoicing, SCIM, or advanced security controls.

Learn more about [Teams pricing](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/pricing).

## [Auto](https://cursor.com/docs/account/pricing\#auto)

Enabling Auto allows Cursor to select the premium model best fit for the immediate task and with the highest reliability based on current demand. This feature can detect degraded output performance and automatically switch models to resolve it.

![Model picker](https://cursor.com/docs-static/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs-static%2Fimages%2Fmodels%2Fmodel-picker.png&w=1920&q=75)

We've heavily invested in the quality and overall performance of Auto. Starting at your next billing renewal after September 15, Auto consumes usage at the following API rates.

- **Input + Cache Write**: $1.25 per 1M tokens
- **Output**: $6.00 per 1M tokens
- **Cache Read**: $0.25 per 1M tokens

Both the editor and dashboard will show your usage, which includes Auto. If you prefer to select a model directly, usage is incurred at that model's list API price.

## [Max Mode](https://cursor.com/docs/account/pricing\#max-mode)

Certain models have the ability to use [Max Mode](https://cursor.com/docs/models#max-mode), which allows for longer reasoning and larger context windows up to 1M tokens. While the majority of coding tasks do not need to use Max Mode, it can be helpful for more complex queries, especially with large files or codebases. Using Max Mode will consume more usage. You can view all requests and token breakdowns on [your dashboard](https://cursor.com/dashboard?tab=usage).

## [Bugbot](https://cursor.com/docs/account/pricing\#bugbot)

Bugbot is a separate product from Cursor subscriptions and has its own pricing plan.

- **Pro** ($40/mo): Unlimited reviews on up to 200 PRs/month, unlimited access to Cursor Ask, integration with Cursor to fix bugs, and access to Bugbot Rules
- **Teams** ($40/user/mo): Unlimited code reviews across all PRs, unlimited access to Cursor Ask, pooled usage across your team, and advanced rules and settings
- **Enterprise** (Custom): Everything in Teams plus advanced analytics and reporting, priority support, and account management

Learn more about [Bugbot pricing](https://cursor.com/bugbot#pricing).

## [Background Agent](https://cursor.com/docs/account/pricing\#background-agent)

Background Agents are charged at API pricing for the selected [model](https://cursor.com/docs/models). You'll be asked to set a spend limit for Background Agents when you first start using them.

Virtual Machine (VM) compute for background agents will be priced in the
future.

# Git

Cursor provides AI-powered Git features to streamline your workflow, including automatic commit message generation and intelligent merge conflict resolution.

## [AI Commit Message](https://cursor.com/docs/integrations/git\#ai-commit-message)

Cursor generates commit messages from staged changes.

1. Stage files to commit
2. Open the Git tab in the sidebar
3. Click the sparkle (✨) icon next to the commit message input

Generated messages use staged changes and repository git history. If you use conventions like [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/), messages follow the same pattern.

### [Add shortcut](https://cursor.com/docs/integrations/git\#add-shortcut)

To bind to a keyboard shortcut:

1. Go to Keyboard Shortcuts ( `Cmd+R Cmd+S` or `Cmd+Shift+P` and search "Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)")

2. Add this binding for `Cmd+M`:















```
{
     "key": "cmd+m",
     "command": "cursor.generateGitCommitMessage"
}
```

3. Save


You cannot customize commit message generation. Cursor adapts to your existing
commit style.

## [AI Resolve Conflicts](https://cursor.com/docs/integrations/git\#ai-resolve-conflicts)

When merge conflicts occur, Cursor Agent can help resolve them by understanding both sides of the conflict and proposing a resolution.

### [How to use](https://cursor.com/docs/integrations/git\#how-to-use)

1. When a merge conflict occurs, you'll see the conflict markers in your file
2. Click the **Resolve in Chat** button that appears in the merge conflict UI
3. Agent will analyze both versions and suggest a resolution
4. Review the proposed changes and apply them

# Reuse Existing Code

Configure Cursor's AI to search for existing code before generating new solutions. This prevents duplicate implementations.

## [Add the AI Rule](https://cursor.com/docs/reuse-existing-code\#add-the-ai-rule)

1. Open Command Palette ( `Cmd + Shift + P`)
2. Select `New Cursor Rule`
3. Add this instruction:

```
Before generating code, you MUST:

1. Rephrase the request as: "I am looking for code that does [requested functionality], is there existing code that can do this?"
2. Search the codebase for similar solutions
3. Only generate new code if no suitable existing solution is found
4. If creating new code, explain why existing solutions weren't suitable

Goal: Maintain a cohesive codebase by finding and reusing existing code patterns.
```

## [How It Works](https://cursor.com/docs/reuse-existing-code\#how-it-works)

When you ask:

```rounded-sm border border-border bg-card/80 p-1 font-mono text-xs
"Write a function that handles user authentication"

```

The AI searches:

```rounded-sm border border-border bg-card/80 p-1 font-mono text-xs
"I am looking for code that handles user authentication, is there existing code that can do this?"

```

# Webhooks

When you create an agent with a webhook URL, Cursor will send HTTP POST requests to notify you about status changes. Currently, only `statusChange` events are supported, specifically when an agent encounters an `ERROR` or `FINISHED` state.

## [Webhook verification](https://cursor.com/docs/background-agent/api/webhooks\#webhook-verification)

To ensure the webhook requests are authentically from Cursor, verify the signature included with each request:

### [Headers](https://cursor.com/docs/background-agent/api/webhooks\#headers)

Each webhook request includes the following headers:

- **`X-Webhook-Signature`** – Contains the HMAC-SHA256 signature in the format `sha256=<hex_digest>`
- **`X-Webhook-ID`** – A unique identifier for this delivery (useful for logging)
- **`X-Webhook-Event`** – The event type (currently only `statusChange`)
- **`User-Agent`** – Always set to `Cursor-Agent-Webhook/1.0`

### [Signature verification](https://cursor.com/docs/background-agent/api/webhooks\#signature-verification)

To verify the webhook signature, compute the expected signature and compare it with the received signature:

```
const crypto = require("crypto");

function verifyWebhook(secret, rawBody, signature) {
  const expectedSignature =
    "sha256=" +
    crypto.createHmac("sha256", secret).update(rawBody).digest("hex");

  return signature === expectedSignature;
}
```

```
import hmac
import hashlib

def verify_webhook(secret, raw_body, signature):
    expected_signature = 'sha256=' + hmac.new(
        secret.encode(),
        raw_body,
        hashlib.sha256
    ).hexdigest()

    return signature == expected_signature
```

Always use the raw request body (before any parsing) when computing the signature.

## [Payload format](https://cursor.com/docs/background-agent/api/webhooks\#payload-format)

The webhook payload is sent as JSON with the following structure:

```
{
  "event": "statusChange",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "id": "bc_abc123",
  "status": "FINISHED",
  "source": {
    "repository": "https://github.com/your-org/your-repo",
    "ref": "main"
  },
  "target": {
    "url": "https://cursor.com/agents?id=bc_abc123",
    "branchName": "cursor/add-readme-1234",
    "prUrl": "https://github.com/your-org/your-repo/pull/1234"
  },
  "summary": "Added README.md with installation instructions"
}
```

Note that some fields are optional and will only be included when available.

## [Best practices](https://cursor.com/docs/background-agent/api/webhooks\#best-practices)

- **Verify signatures** – Always verify the webhook signature to ensure the request is from Cursor
- **Handle retries** – Webhooks may be retried if your endpoint returns an error status code
- **Return quickly** – Return a 2xx status code as soon as possible
- **Use HTTPS** – Always use HTTPS URLs for webhook endpoints in production
- **Store raw payloads** – Store the raw webhook payload for debugging and future verification

# Deeplinks

Deeplinks allow you to share prompts and commands with others, enabling collaboration and knowledge sharing across teams and communities.

Links can also be opened via [cursor.com](https://cursor.com/). Append the path and url params to the end of the url, for example: [cursor.com/link/prompt?text=...](https://cursor.com/link/prompt?text=Research+and+find+one+bug+in+this+codebase)

Always review your prompts and commands before sharing to ensure they don't contain sensitive information like API keys, passwords, or proprietary code.

### [Prompts](https://cursor.com/docs/integrations/deeplinks\#prompts)

Share prompts that others can use to get started quickly with specific tasks or workflows. When someone clicks a prompt deeplink, it opens Cursor with the prompt pre-filled in the chat. The user must review and confirm the prompt before it gets executed. Deeplinks never trigger automatic execution.

Research and find one bug in this codebase

Progress circle

Copy link

#### [API](https://cursor.com/docs/integrations/deeplinks\#api)

You can generate deeplinks programmatically in your applications. Here are minimal implementations for common languages:

TypeScriptPython

```
function generatePromptDeeplink(promptText: string): string {
  const url = new URL('cursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/prompt');
  url.searchParams.set('text', promptText);
  return url.toString();
}

const deeplink = generatePromptDeeplink("Create a React component for user authentication");
console.log(deeplink);
```

The deeplink URL has a maximum length of 8,000 characters. When generating deeplinks programmatically, ensure your prompt text doesn't exceed this limit when URL-encoded.

#### [Web Format](https://cursor.com/docs/integrations/deeplinks\#web-format)

You can also use the web-based format by switching the scheme and domain. This format works in browsers and can redirect to the Cursor app:

```
function generateWebPromptDeeplink(promptText: string): string {
  const url = new URL('https://cursor.com/link/prompt');
  url.searchParams.set('text', promptText);
  return url.toString();
}

const webDeeplink = generateWebPromptDeeplink("Create a React component for user authentication");
console.log(webDeeplink);
```

# Agent Security

AI can behave unexpectedly due to prompt injection, hallucinations, and other issues. We protect users with guardrails that limit what agents can do. By default, sensitive actions require your manual approval. This document explains our guardrails and what they mean for you.

These controls and behaviors are our defaults. We recommend keeping them enabled.

## [First-party tool calls](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/security\#first-party-tool-calls)

Cursor includes tools that help agents write code: reading files, editing files, running terminal commands, searching the web, and more.

Reading files and searching code don't require approval. Use [.cursorignore](https://cursor.com/docs/context/ignore-files) to block agent access to specific files. Actions that could expose sensitive data require your explicit approval.

Agents can modify workspace files without approval, except for configuration files. Changes save immediately to disk. Always use version control so you can revert changes. Configuration files (like workspace settings) need your approval first.

**Warning:** If you have auto-reload enabled, agent changes might execute before you can review them.

Terminal commands need your approval by default. Review every command before letting the agent run it.

You can enable auto-approval if you accept the risk. We have an [allowlist](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/tools) feature, but it's not a security guarantee. The allowlist is best-effort—bypasses are possible. Never use "Run Everything" mode, which skips all safety checks.

## [Third-party tool calls](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/security\#third-party-tool-calls)

You can connect external tools using [MCP](https://cursor.com/docs/context/mcp). All MCP connections need your approval. After you approve an MCP connection, each tool call still needs individual approval before running.

## [Network requests](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/security\#network-requests)

Attackers could use network requests to steal data. Our tools only make network requests to:

- GitHub
- Direct link retrieval
- Web search providers

Agents cannot make arbitrary network requests with default settings.

## [Workspace trust](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/security\#workspace-trust)

Cursor supports [workspace trust](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editing/workspaces/workspace-trust), but it's disabled by default. When enabled, it prompts you to choose between normal or restricted mode for new workspaces. Restricted mode breaks AI features. For untrusted repos, use a basic text editor instead.

To enable workspace trust:

1. Open your user settings.json file

2. Add the following configuration:















```
"security.workspace.trust.enabled": true
```


Organizations can enforce this setting through MDM solutions.

## [Responsible disclosure](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/security\#responsible-disclosure)

Found a vulnerability? Report it on our GitHub Security page. Can't use GitHub? Email [security@cursor.com](mailto:security@cursor.com).

We acknowledge vulnerability reports within 5 business days. We publish security advisories on our GitHub security page. For critical incidents, we notify all users via email and GitHub.

# AI Commit Message

Cursor generates commit messages from staged changes.

1. Stage files to commit
2. Open the Git tab in the sidebar
3. Click the sparkle (✨) icon next to the commit message input

Generated messages use staged changes and repository git history. If you use conventions like [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/), messages follow the same pattern.

## [Add shortcut](https://cursor.com/docs/more/ai-commit-message\#add-shortcut)

To bind to a keyboard shortcut:

1. Go to Keyboard Shortcuts ( `Cmd+R Cmd+S` or `Cmd+Shift+P` and search "Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)")
2. Add this binding for `Cmd+M`:















```
{
     "key": "cmd+m",
     "command": "cursor.generateGitCommitMessage"
}
```

3. Save

You cannot customize commit message generation. Cursor adapts to your existing
commit style.

# Web Development

Web development involves fast iterations and tight feedback loops between Cursor and external tools like Figma or the browser. At Cursor, we've found workflows that tighten this loop. Clear task scoping, reusing components, and leveraging design systems help keep things fast and consistent.

This guide covers how to set up Cursor to support web development and tighten the feedback loop.

## [Start orchestrating in Cursor](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/tools/web-development\#start-orchestrating-in-cursor)

**Chat** is great for bootstrapping changes. Once the major pieces are in place, switching to **Inline Edit** and **Tab** helps maintain your flow state.

After setting up Cursor, you'll be able to orchestrate workflows across different tools. Below is a demonstration of what's possible: a snake game created by combining Linear, Figma, and browser tools. While real-world projects are typically more complex, this example showcases the potential of these integrated workflows.

## [Connect to your project management tools](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/tools/web-development\#connect-to-your-project-management-tools)

You can integrate Cursor into your existing project management software using different tooling. In this guide, we'll look at integrating Linear with their MCP server.

### [Linear Installation](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/tools/web-development\#linear-installation)

Add the Linear MCP server to `mcp.json`:

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Linear": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [\
        "-y",\
        "mcp-remote",\
        "https://mcp.linear.app/sse"\
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Then:

1. Make sure to enable Linear from MCP settings
2. Web browser will open and you will be prompted to authorize with Linear

### [Using Linear in Cursor](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/tools/web-development\#using-linear-in-cursor)

Linear MCP servers expose different tools that Cursor can use to read and manage issues. Go to MCP settings an locate the Linear server to see a list of all tools. To verify, try this prompt in Chat:

```
list all issues related to this project
```

![linear.png](https://cursor.com/docs-static/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs-static%2Fimages%2Fguides%2Ftutorials%2Fweb-development%2Flinear.png&w=1920&q=75)

It should return a list of issues if the integration is set up properly.

## [Bring in your Figma designs](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/tools/web-development\#bring-in-your-figma-designs)

Designs and mockups are core to web development. Using the official MCP server for Figma, you can directly access and work with design files in Cursor. To get started, follow the set up instructions at [Figma Dev Mode MCP Server](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/32132100833559-Guide-to-the-Dev-Mode-MCP-Server).

### [Figma Installation](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/tools/web-development\#figma-installation)

Add the Figma MCP server to `mcp.json`:

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Figma": {
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:3845/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

### [Usage](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/tools/web-development\#usage)

The server exposes multiple tools you can use in your prompts. E.g try to ask for the designs of the current selection in Figma. Read more in the [documentation](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/32132100833559-Guide-to-the-Dev-Mode-MCP-Server).

![figma.png](https://cursor.com/docs-static/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs-static%2Fimages%2Fguides%2Ftutorials%2Fweb-development%2Ffigma.png&w=1920&q=75)

## [Keep your code scaffolding consistent](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/tools/web-development\#keep-your-code-scaffolding-consistent)

You probably have existing code, a design system, or established conventions you want to reuse. When working with models, it's helpful to reference patterns already in your codebase, such as dropdown menus or other common components.

Working in a large web-based codebase ourselves, we've found that declarative code works especially well, particularly for React and JSX.

If you have a design system, you can help the agent discover it by providing a rule for it. Here's a `ui-components.mdc` file where we try to enforce reuse of components when possible:

```
---
description: Implementing designs and building UI
---
- reuse existing UI components from `/src/components/ui`. these are the primitives we can build with
- create new components by orchestrating ui components if you can't find any existing that solves the problem
- ask the human how they want to proceed when there are missing components and designs
```

As your component library grows, add new rules accordingly. When the rules become too numerous, consider splitting them into more specific categories, such as "only apply when working with user inputs."

![ui-components.png](https://cursor.com/docs-static/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs-static%2Fimages%2Fguides%2Ftutorials%2Fweb-development%2Fcomponents.png&w=1920&q=75)

## [Give Cursor access to browser](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/tools/web-development\#give-cursor-access-to-browser)

To extend Cursor's capabilities, you can set up the browser tools MCP server, which provides access to console logs and network requests. Once configured, you can verify your changes by monitoring console output and network activity. This set up helps ensure your implementation matches your intention. Follow the instructions here to set up the MCP server: [https://browsertools.agentdesk.ai/installation](https://browsertools.agentdesk.ai/installation)

![browser.png](https://cursor.com/docs-static/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs-static%2Fimages%2Fguides%2Ftutorials%2Fweb-development%2Fbrowser-tools.png&w=1920&q=75)

## [Takeaways](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/tools/web-development\#takeaways)

- Tight feedback loops are essential in web development. Use Cursor alongside tools like Figma, Linear, and the browser to move quickly and stay in flow.
- MCP servers let you integrate external systems directly into Cursor, reducing context switching and improving task execution.
- Reusing components and design systems helps the model produce cleaner, more consistent code and outputs.
- Clear, scoped tasks lead to better results. Be intentional with how you prompt and what you ask for.
- If you're not getting good outputs, try adjusting instructions (use rules, prompts, and give access to more context like MCP servers) or systems (patterns, abstractions, and clarity help the model understand and work more autonomously).
- You can extend the model's context by including runtime info like console logs, network requests, and UI element data.
- Not everything needs to be automated. If your system becomes too complex, fall back to more surgical edits with Tab and Inline Edit.
- Cursor is most powerful when it's a co-pilot, not an autopilot. Use it to improve, not replace, your own decision-making.

        };
      }

      export interface RemoteServerConfig {
        name: string;
        server: {
          url: string;
          /**
           * Optional HTTP headers to include with every request to this server (e.g. for authentication).
           * The keys are header names and the values are header values.
           */
          headers?: Record<string, string>;
        };
      }

      export type ExtMCPServerConfig = StdioServerConfig | RemoteServerConfig;

      /**
       * Register an MCP server that the Cursor extension can communicate with.
       *
       * The server can be exposed either over HTTP(S) (SSE/streamable HTTP) **or** as a local
       * stdio process.
       */
      export const registerServer: (config: ExtMCPServerConfig) => void;

# Extensions

Cursor supports VS Code extensions, allowing you to enhance your development environment with additional functionality. Extensions can be installed from the built-in marketplace or directly using extension URLs.

## [Extension registry](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/extensions\#extension-registry)

Cursor uses the Open VSX registry to provide extensions. However, unlike the standard Open VSX implementation, **Cursor independently verifies all extensions** for security and compatibility.

This verification process ensures:

- Extensions are safe to use
- They work properly with Cursor's AI features
- Performance remains optimal

While Cursor is built on VS Code's foundation, not all VS Code extensions may
be available or work exactly the same way due to Cursor's additional AI
capabilities and verification requirements.

## [Installing extensions](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/extensions\#installing-extensions)

### [Using the extensions panel](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/extensions\#using-the-extensions-panel)

The easiest way to install extensions is through the Extensions panel:

1. Open the Extensions view ( `⌘`/ `Ctrl` \+ `Shift` \+ `X`)
2. Search for the extension you want
3. Click Install

### [Using extension URLs](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/extensions\#using-extension-urls)

You can also open extensions directly using a special URL pattern:

```
cursor:extension/publisher.extensionname
```

For example, to open the ChatGPT extension page:

```
cursor:extension/openai.chatgpt
```

This pattern is useful for:

- Sharing specific extensions with team members
- Creating documentation with direct links to extensions
- Automating extension installation in setup scripts

## [Managing extensions](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/extensions\#managing-extensions)

### [Viewing installed extensions](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/extensions\#viewing-installed-extensions)

To see your installed extensions:

1. Open the Extensions panel ( `⌘`/ `Ctrl` \+ `Shift` \+ `X`)
2. Click on the "Installed" filter

### [Disabling or uninstalling](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/extensions\#disabling-or-uninstalling)

Right-click on any installed extension to:

- Disable the extension temporarily
- Uninstall it completely
- Configure extension-specific settings

### [Extension settings](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/extensions\#extension-settings)

Many extensions come with configurable settings. To access them:

1. Open Settings ( `⌘`/ `Ctrl` \+ `,`)
2. Search for the extension name
3. Modify the available settings

## [Publisher verification](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/extensions\#publisher-verification)

Extension publishers can request verification to display a verification badge in the marketplace. Verified publishers have undergone additional security review and identity confirmation.

### [Requesting verification](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/extensions\#requesting-verification)

To request verification for your extension:

1

### Add marketplace links to your website

On your public website, add a link to the OpenVSX listing for your extension. Place this link prominently (such as in the installation section) alongside links to other marketplaces.

2

### Ensure consistent extension IDs

If your extension is published on multiple marketplaces, use the same
extension ID on OpenVSX as you do elsewhere.

3

### Submit a verification request

Create a [forum post](https://forum.cursor.com/) containing: - Your extension
name - A link to your website where we can verify the OpenVSX registry link

4

### Wait for review

We'll verify the link and add the verification badge to your publisher name once approved.

The verification process helps users identify trusted extensions and ensures a
higher standard of security and authenticity in the marketplace.

## [Importing from VS Code](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/extensions\#importing-from-vs-code)

If you're migrating from VS Code, you can import all your extensions automatically. See our [VS Code migration guide](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/migrations/vscode) for detailed instructions.

# Large Codebases

Working with large codebases introduces a new set of challenges than working on smaller projects. Drawing from both our experience scaling Cursor's own codebase and insights from customers managing massive codebases, we've discovered some useful patterns for handling increased complexity.

Let's explore some of these techniques that we've found be useful for large codebases.

## [Use Chat to quickly get up to speed on unfamiliar code](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/tools/large-codebases\#use-chat-to-quickly-get-up-to-speed-on-unfamiliar-code)

Navigating a large codebase, especially if it's new to you, can be challenging. You often grep, search, and click around to find the specific parts of the codebase you're looking for. With [Chat](https://cursor.com/docs/chat/overview), you can start asking questions to find what you're looking for and get a detailed explanation of how it works.

Here we're getting help to find implementation details of codebase indexing in Cursor, and even asking for some examples to make it easier to understand.

## [Write rules for domain-specific knowledge](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/tools/large-codebases\#write-rules-for-domain-specific-knowledge)

If you were onboarding a new collaborator into your codebase, what context would you give them to make sure they can start doing meaningful contributions?

Your answer to this question is likely valuable information for Cursor to understand as well. For every organization or project, there's latent knowledge that might not be fully captured in your documentation. Using rules effectively is the single best way to ensure Cursor is getting the full picture.

For example, if you're writing instructions for how to implement a new feature or service, consider writing a short rule to document it for posterity.

```
---
description: Add a new VSCode frontend service
---

1. **Interface Definition:**
   - Define a new service interface using `createDecorator` and ensure `_serviceBrand` is included to avoid errors.

2. **Service Implementation:**
   - Implement the service in a new TypeScript file, extending `Disposable`, and register it as a singleton with `registerSingleton`.

3. **Service Contribution:**
   - Create a contribution file to import and load the service, and register it in the main entrypoint.

4. **Context Integration:**
   - Update the context to include the new service, allowing access throughout the application.
```

If there are common formatting patterns that you want to make sure Cursor adheres to, consider auto-attaching rules based on glob patterns.

```
---
globs: *.ts
---
- Use bun as package manager. See [package.json](mdc:backend/reddit-eval-tool/package.json) for scripts
- Use kebab-case for file names
- Use camelCase for function and variable names
- Use UPPERCASE_SNAKE_CASE for hardcoded constants
- Prefer `function foo()` over `const foo = () =>`
- Use `Array<T>` instead of `T[]`
- Use named exports over default exports, e.g (`export const variable ...`, `export function `)
```

## [Stay close to the plan-creation process](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/tools/large-codebases\#stay-close-to-the-plan-creation-process)

For larger changes, spending an above-average amount of thought to create a precise, well-scoped plan can significantly improve Cursor's output.

If you find that you're not getting the result you want after a few different variations of the same prompt, consider zooming out and creating a more detailed plan from scratch, as if you were creating a PRD for a coworker. Oftentimes **the hard part is figuring out what** change should be made, a task suited well for humans. With the right instructions, we can delegate some parts of the implementation to Cursor.

One way to use AI to augment the plan-creation process is to use Ask mode. To create a plan, turn on Ask mode in Cursor and dump whatever context you have from your project management systems, internal docs, or loose thoughts. Think about what files and dependencies you have in the codebase that you already know you want to include. This can be a file that includes pieces of code you want to integrate with, or perhaps a whole folder.

Here's an example prompt:

Planning prompt

```
- create a plan for how we shoud create a new feature (just like @existingfeature.ts)
- ask me questions (max 3) if anything is unclear
- make sure to search the codebase

@Past Chats (my earlier exploration prompts)

here's some more context from [project management tool]:
[pasted ticket description]
```

We're asking the model to create a plan and gather context by asking the human questions, referencing any earlier exploration prompts and also the ticket descriptions. Using a thinking model like `claude-3.7-sonnet`, `gemini-2.5-pro`, or `o3` is recommended as they can understand the intent of the change and better synthesize a plan.

From this, you can iteratively formulate the plan with the help of Cursor before starting implementation.

## [Pick the right tool for the job](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/tools/large-codebases\#pick-the-right-tool-for-the-job)

One of the most important skills in using Cursor effectively is choosing the right tool for the job. Think about what you're trying to accomplish and pick the approach that will keep you in flow.

| **Tool** | **Use case** | **Strength** | **Limitation** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **[Tab](https://cursor.com/docs/tab/overview)** | Quick, manual changes | Full control, fast | Single-file |
| **[Inline Edit](https://cursor.com/docs/inline-edit/overview)** | Scoped changes in one file | Focused edits | Single-file |
| **[Chat](https://cursor.com/docs/chat/overview)** | Larger, multi-file changes | Auto-gathers context, deep edits | Slower, context-heavy |

Each tool has its sweet spot:

- Tab is your go-to for quick edits where you want to be in the driver's seat
- Inline Edit shines when you need to make focused changes to a specific section of code
- Chat is perfect for those bigger changes where you need Cursor to understand the broader context

When you're using Chat mode (which can feel a bit slower but is incredibly powerful), help it help you by providing good context. Use [@files](https://cursor.com/docs/context/symbols) to point to similar code you want to emulate, or [@folder](https://cursor.com/docs/context/symbols) to give it a better understanding of your project structure. And don't be afraid to break bigger changes into smaller chunks - starting fresh chats helps keep things focused and efficient.

## [Takeaways](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/tools/large-codebases\#takeaways)

- Scope down changes and don't try to do too much at once
- Include relevant context when you can
- Use Chat, Inline Edit & Tab for what they're best at
- Create new chats often
- Plan with [Ask mode](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/modes), implement with [Agent mode](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/overview)

# Ignore files

## [Overview](https://cursor.com/docs/context/ignore-files\#overview)

Cursor reads and indexes your project's codebase to power its features. Control which directories and files Cursor can access using a `.cursorignore` file in your root directory.

Cursor blocks access to files listed in `.cursorignore` from:

- Codebase indexing
- Code accessible by [Tab](https://cursor.com/docs/tab/overview), [Agent](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/overview), and [Inline Edit](https://cursor.com/docs/inline-edit/overview)
- Code accessible via [@ symbol references](https://cursor.com/docs/context/symbols/overview)

The terminal and MCP server tools used by Agent cannot block access to code
governed by `.cursorignore`

## [Why ignore files?](https://cursor.com/docs/context/ignore-files\#why-ignore-files)

**Security**: Restrict access to API keys, credentials, and secrets. While Cursor blocks ignored files, complete protection isn't guaranteed due to LLM unpredictability.

**Performance**: In large codebases or monorepos, exclude irrelevant portions for faster indexing and more accurate file discovery.

## [Global ignore files](https://cursor.com/docs/context/ignore-files\#global-ignore-files)

Set ignore patterns for all projects in user settings to exclude sensitive files without per-project configuration.

![Global Cursor Ignore List](https://cursor.com/docs-static/images/settings/global-ignore.png)

Default patterns include:

- Environment files: `**/.env`, `**/.env.*`
- Credentials: `**/credentials.json`, `**/secrets.json`
- Keys: `**/*.key`, `**/*.pem`, `**/id_rsa`

## [Configuring `.cursorignore`](https://cursor.com/docs/context/ignore-files\#configuring-cursorignore)

Create a `.cursorignore` file in your root directory using `.gitignore` syntax.

### [Pattern examples](https://cursor.com/docs/context/ignore-files\#pattern-examples)

```
config.json      # Specific file
dist/           # Directory
*.log           # File extension
**/logs         # Nested directories
!app/           # Exclude from ignore (negate)
```

### [Hierarchical ignore](https://cursor.com/docs/context/ignore-files\#hierarchical-ignore)

Enable `Cursor Settings` \> `Features` \> `Editor` \> `Hierarchical Cursor Ignore` to search parent directories for `.cursorignore` files.

**Notes**: Comments start with `#`. Later patterns override earlier ones. Patterns are relative to file location.

## [Limit indexing with `.cursorindexingignore`](https://cursor.com/docs/context/ignore-files\#limit-indexing-with-cursorindexingignore)

Use `.cursorindexingignore` to exclude files from indexing only. These files remain accessible to AI features but won't appear in codebase searches.

## [Files ignored by default](https://cursor.com/docs/context/ignore-files\#files-ignored-by-default)

Cursor automatically ignores files in `.gitignore` and the default ignore list below. Override with `!` prefix in `.cursorignore`.

### Default Ignore List

### [Negation pattern limitations](https://cursor.com/docs/context/ignore-files\#negation-pattern-limitations)

When using negation patterns (prefixed with `!`), you cannot re-include a file if a parent directory is excluded via \*.

```
# Ignore all files in public folder
public/*

# ✅ This works, as the file exists at the top level
!public/index.html

# ❌ This doesn't work - cannot re-include files from nested directories
!public/assets/style.css
```

**Workaround**: Explicitly exclude nested directories:

```
public/assets/*
!public/assets/style.css # This file is now accessible
```

Excluded directories are not traversed for performance, so patterns on contained files have no effect.
This matches the .gitignore implementation for negation patterns in nested directories. For more details, see the [official Git documentation on gitignore patterns](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore).

## [Troubleshooting](https://cursor.com/docs/context/ignore-files\#troubleshooting)

Test patterns with `git check-ignore -v [file]`.

# Identity and Access Management

Identity and access management controls who can use Cursor in your organization and what they can do. You'll set up authentication, automate user provisioning, and enforce policies through device management.

We recommend implementing identity controls in this order:

1. **Set up SSO**: Get centralized authentication working first
2. **Enable SCIM**: Automate user lifecycle management
3. **Deploy MDM policies**: Enforce allowed team IDs and extensions
4. **Assign roles**: Grant admin access to the right people

## [Single Sign-On (SSO) and SAML](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/identity-and-access-management\#single-sign-on-sso-and-saml)

SSO lets your users authenticate to Cursor using your existing identity provider. Instead of creating separate Cursor passwords, users log in with their corporate credentials.

Cursor supports SAML 2.0 integration with providers like Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace, and OneLogin. When you enable SSO, you can require it for all team members, preventing password-based authentication entirely.

See [SSO and SAML setup](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/sso) for detailed configuration instructions.

## [SCIM provisioning](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/identity-and-access-management\#scim-provisioning)

SCIM 2.0 provisioning automatically manages your team members and directory groups through your identity provider. Available on Enterprise plans with SSO enabled.

Without SCIM, you need to manually add users to your Cursor team and remove them when they leave. With SCIM:

- New employees get Cursor access automatically when added to the right group
- Departing employees lose access when removed from your IDP
- Group membership changes propagate automatically

See [SCIM provisioning](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/scim) for setup instructions.

## [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/identity-and-access-management\#role-based-access-control-rbac)

Cursor teams have three roles: Members, Admins, and Unpaid Admins.

See [Members & Roles](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/members) for more information.

## [MDM policies](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/identity-and-access-management\#mdm-policies)

Mobile Device Management (MDM) systems let you enforce policies on user devices. Cursor supports MDM-based policies on macOS and Windows to ensure users comply with organizational requirements.

See [Deployment Patterns](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/deployment-patterns#mdm-configuration) for platform-specific MDM configuration instructions.

### [Allowed Team IDs](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/identity-and-access-management\#allowed-team-ids)

The most important MDM policy prevents users from logging into personal Cursor accounts on corporate devices.

When you set an allowed team ID policy, Cursor only permits authentication to those specific team IDs. If a user tries to log in with a different team ID (like a personal account), Cursor logs them out immediately.

For example, if your employees have corporate laptops, you can set the allowed team ID to your enterprise team ID. This prevents them from accidentally using personal accounts that might not have Privacy Mode enabled.

The `cursorAuth.allowedTeamId` Cursor setting controls which team IDs are permitted to log into Cursor. This setting accepts a comma-separated list of team IDs that are authorized for access.

For example, setting `cursorAuth.allowedTeamId` to `"1,3,7"` allows users from those specific team IDs to log in.

When a user attempts to log in with a team ID that is not in the allowed list:

- They are forcefully logged out immediately
- An error message is displayed
- The application prevents further authentication attempts until a valid team ID is used

To centrally manage allowed team IDs for your organization, configure the `AllowedTeamId` policy using your device management solution. This policy overrides the `cursorAuth.allowedTeamId` setting on users' devices. The value of this policy is a string containing the comma-separated list of authorized team IDs.

See [Deployment Patterns](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/deployment-patterns#mdm-configuration) for platform-specific MDM configuration instructions.

### [Allowed Extensions](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/identity-and-access-management\#allowed-extensions)

Control which extensions users can install in Cursor. Extensions can access your workspace, so you want to ensure only trusted extensions run.

**How it works:**

The `extensions.allowed` Cursor setting controls which extensions can be installed. This setting accepts a JSON object where keys are publisher names and values are booleans indicating whether extensions from that publisher are allowed.

For example, setting `extensions.allowed` to `{"anysphere": true, "github": true}` allows extensions from Anysphere and GitHub publishers, while setting it to `{"anysphere": false}` blocks Anysphere extensions.

You can be more specific by including the full extension ID:

```
{
  "anysphere": true,
  "github": true,
  "ms-azuretools.vscode-docker": true
}
```

This allows extensions from Anysphere, GitHub, and Microsoft while blocking all others.

To centrally manage allowed extensions for your organization, configure the `AllowedExtensions` policy using your device management solution. This policy overrides the `extensions.allowed` setting on users' devices. The value of this policy is a JSON string that defines the allowed publishers.

See [Deployment Patterns](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/deployment-patterns#mdm-configuration) for platform-specific MDM configuration instructions.

### [The .cursor folder](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/identity-and-access-management\#the-cursor-folder)

When you open a project in Cursor, the IDE creates a `.cursor` folder at the root of your repository. This folder contains:

- Project-specific settings
- Indexing cache
- Project rules and context

This folder can be checked into source control. Your team members benefit from shared rules and settings, but be aware that these configurations are visible to anyone with repository access.

For repositories you don't control access to, review the `.cursor` folder contents before committing. Don't put sensitive information in rules files.

You can also manage rules and commands through the server on the [team dashboard](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/dashboard).

### [Workspace Trust](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/identity-and-access-management\#workspace-trust)

Cursor supports [workspace trust](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editing/workspaces/workspace-trust), but it's disabled by default. When enabled, it prompts you to choose between normal or restricted mode for new workspaces. Restricted mode breaks AI features. For untrusted repos, use a basic text editor instead.

To enable Workspace Trust for your organization, configure the `WorkspaceTrustEnabled` policy using your device management solution. This policy overrides the `security.workspace.trust.enabled` setting on users' devices. Set the value to `true` to enable Workspace Trust.

See [Deployment Patterns](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/deployment-patterns#mdm-configuration) for platform-specific MDM configuration instructions.

To enable workspace trust:

1. Open your user settings.json file

2. Add the following configuration:















```
"security.workspace.trust.enabled": true
```


See [Deployment Patterns](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/deployment-patterns#mdm-configuration) for platform-specific MDM configuration instructions.

# Slack

With Cursor's integration for Slack, you can use [Background Agents](https://cursor.com/docs/background-agent) to work on your tasks directly from Slack by mentioning `@cursor` with a prompt.

## [Get started](https://cursor.com/docs/integrations/slack\#get-started)

### [Installation](https://cursor.com/docs/integrations/slack\#installation)

1. Go to [Cursor integrations](https://www.cursor.com/dashboard?tab=integrations)

2. Click _Connect_ next to Slack or go to [installation page](https://cursor.com/api/install-slack-app) from here

3. You'll be prompted to install the Cursor app for Slack in your workspace.

4. After installing in Slack, you'll be redirected back to Cursor to finalize setup
1. Connect GitHub (if not already connected) and pick a default repository
2. Enable usage-based pricing
3. Confirm privacy settings
5. Start using Background Agents in Slack by mentioning `@cursor`


## [How to use](https://cursor.com/docs/integrations/slack\#how-to-use)

Mention `@cursor` and give your prompt. This handles most use cases, but you can also use commands below to customize your agent.

For example, mention `@Cursor fix the login bug` directly in conversation, or use specific commands like `@Cursor [repo=torvalds/linux] fix bug` to target a particular repository.

### [Commands](https://cursor.com/docs/integrations/slack\#commands)

Run `@Cursor help` for an up-to-date command list.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `@Cursor [prompt]` | Start a Background Agent. In threads with existing agents, adds followup instructions |
| `@Cursor settings` | Configure defaults and channel's default repository |
| `@Cursor [options] [prompt]` | Use advanced options: `branch`, `model`, `repo` |
| `@Cursor agent [prompt]` | Force create a new agent in a thread |
| `@Cursor list my agents` | Show your running agents |

#### [Options](https://cursor.com/docs/integrations/slack\#options)

Customize Background Agent behavior with these options:

| Option | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `branch` | Specify base branch | `branch=main` |
| `model` | Choose AI model | `model=o3` |
| `repo` | Target specific repository | `repo=owner/repo` |
| `autopr` | Enable/disable automatic PR creation | `autopr=false` |

#### [Syntax Formats](https://cursor.com/docs/integrations/slack\#syntax-formats)

Brackets:

```
@Cursor [branch=dev, model=o3, repo=owner/repo, autopr=false] Fix the login bug
```

Inline:

```
@Cursor branch=dev model=o3 repo=owner/repo autopr=false Fix the login bug
```

#### [Option precedence](https://cursor.com/docs/integrations/slack\#option-precedence)

When combining options:

- **Explicit values** override defaults
- **Later values** override earlier ones if duplicated
- **Inline options** take precedence over settings modal defaults

The bot parses options from anywhere in the message, allowing natural command writing.

#### [Using thread context](https://cursor.com/docs/integrations/slack\#using-thread-context)

Background Agents understand and use context from existing thread discussions. Useful when your team discusses an issue and you want the agent to implement the solution based on that conversation.

Background Agents read the entire thread for context when invoked,
understanding and implementing solutions based on the team's discussion.

#### [When to use force commands](https://cursor.com/docs/integrations/slack\#when-to-use-force-commands)

**When do I need `@Cursor agent`?**

In threads with existing agents, `@Cursor [prompt]` adds followup instructions (only works if you own the agent). Use `@Cursor agent [prompt]` to launch a separate agent.

**When do I need `Add follow-up` (from context menu)?**

Use the context menu (⋯) on an agent's response for followup instructions. Useful when multiple agents exist in a thread and you need to specify which one to follow up on.

### [Status updates & handoff](https://cursor.com/docs/integrations/slack\#status-updates-handoff)

When Background Agent runs, you first get an option to _Open in Cursor_.

![Open in Cursor button in Slack](https://cursor.com/docs-static/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs-static%2Fimages%2Fbackground-agent%2Fslack%2Fslack-open-in-cursor.png&w=1920&q=75)

When Background Agent completes, you get a notification in Slack and an option to view the created PR in GitHub.

![View PR in GitHub in Slack](https://cursor.com/docs-static/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs-static%2Fimages%2Fbackground-agent%2Fslack%2Fslack-view-pr.png&w=1920&q=75)

### [Managing agents](https://cursor.com/docs/integrations/slack\#managing-agents)

To see all running agents, run `@Cursor list my agents`.

Manage Background Agents using the context menu by clicking the three dots (⋯) on any agent message.

![Slack agent context menu](https://cursor.com/docs-static/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs-static%2Fimages%2Fbackground-agent%2Fslack%2Fslack-context-menu.png&w=1920&q=75)

Available options:

- **Add follow-up**: Add instructions to an existing agent
- **Delete**: Stop and archive the Background Agent
- **View request ID**: View unique request ID for troubleshooting (include when contacting support)
- **Give feedback**: Provide feedback about agent performance

## [Configuration](https://cursor.com/docs/integrations/slack\#configuration)

Manage default settings and privacy options from [Dashboard → Background Agents](https://www.cursor.com/dashboard?tab=background-agents).

### [Settings](https://cursor.com/docs/integrations/slack\#settings)

#### [Default Model](https://cursor.com/docs/integrations/slack\#default-model)

Used when no model is explicitly specified with `@Cursor [model=...]`. See [settings](https://www.cursor.com/dashboard?tab=background-agents) for available options.

#### [Default Repository](https://cursor.com/docs/integrations/slack\#default-repository)

Used when no repository is specified. Use these formats:

- `https://github.com/org/repository`
- `org/repository`

If you reference a non-existent repository, it appears as if you don't have
access. This shows in the error message when Background Agent fails to start.

#### [Base Branch](https://cursor.com/docs/integrations/slack\#base-branch)

Starting branch for Background Agent. Leave blank to use the repository's default branch (often `main`)

### [Channel Settings](https://cursor.com/docs/integrations/slack\#channel-settings)

Configure default settings at the channel level using `@Cursor settings`. These settings are per team and override your personal defaults for that channel.

Particularly useful when:

- Different channels work on different repositories
- Teams want consistent settings across all members
- You want to avoid specifying the repository in every command

To configure channel settings:

1. Run `@Cursor settings` in the desired channel
2. Set the default repository for that channel
3. All team members using Background Agents in that channel use these defaults

Channel settings take precedence over personal defaults but can be overridden
by explicit options like `@Cursor [repo=...] [prompt]`

### [Privacy](https://cursor.com/docs/integrations/slack\#privacy)

Background Agents support Privacy Mode.

Read more about [Privacy Mode](https://www.cursor.com/privacy-overview) or manage your [privacy settings](https://www.cursor.com/dashboard?tab=background-agents).

Privacy Mode (Legacy) is not supported. Background Agents require temporary
code storage while running.

#### [Display Agent Summary](https://cursor.com/docs/integrations/slack\#display-agent-summary)

Display agent summaries and diff images. May contain file paths or code snippets. Can be turned On/Off.

#### [Display Agent Summary in External Channels](https://cursor.com/docs/integrations/slack\#display-agent-summary-in-external-channels)

For Slack Connect with other workspaces or channels with external members like Guests, choose to display agent summaries in external channels.

## [Permissions](https://cursor.com/docs/integrations/slack\#permissions)

Cursor requests these Slack permissions for Background Agents to work within your workspace:

# Tabs

## [Overview](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/chat/tabs\#overview)

Press `Cmd+T` to create new tabs. Each tab maintains separate conversation history, context, and model selection.

For parallel workflows, try [Background Agents](https://cursor.com/docs/background-agent)

## [Managing tabs](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/chat/tabs\#managing-tabs)

- Create new tabs with `Cmd+T`. Each tab starts with a fresh conversation and maintains its own context.
- Switch between tabs by clicking their headers or using `Ctrl+Tab` to cycle through them.
- Tab titles are auto-generated after the first message. Rename them by right-clicking on the tab header.

Use one task per tab, provide clear initial descriptions, and close finished
tabs to keep your workspace organized.

### [Conflicts](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/chat/tabs\#conflicts)

Cursor prevents multiple tabs from editing the same files. You'll be prompted to resolve conflicts.

## [Reference other chats](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/chat/tabs\#reference-other-chats)

Use [@Past Chats](https://cursor.com/docs/context/symbols#past-chats) to include context from other tabs or previous sessions.

# Browser

Agent can control a web browser to test applications, audit accessibility, convert designs into code, and more. With full access to console logs and network traffic, Agent can debug issues and automate comprehensive testing workflows.

Browser automation is currently not available for enterprise customers. This feature is available for individual and team users.

## [Native integration](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/browser\#native-integration)

Agent displays browser actions like screenshots and actions in the chat, as well as the browser window itself either in a separate window or an inline pane.

We've optimized the browser tools to be more efficient and reduce token usage, as well as:

- **Efficient log handling**: Browser logs are written to files that Agent can grep and selectively read. Instead of summarizing verbose output after every action, Agent reads only the relevant lines it needs. This preserves full context while minimizing token usage.
- **Visual feedback with images**: Screenshots are integrated directly with the file reading tool, so Agent actually sees the browser state as images rather than relying on text descriptions. This enables better understanding of visual layouts and UI elements.
- **Smart prompting**: Agent receives additional context about browser logs, including total line counts and preview snippets, helping it make informed decisions about what to inspect.
- **Development server awareness**: Agent is prompted to detect running development servers and use the correct ports instead of starting duplicate servers or guessing port numbers.

You can use Browser without installing or configuring any external tools.

## [Browser capabilities](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/browser\#browser-capabilities)

Agent has access to the following browser tools:

### Navigate

### Click

### Type

### Scroll

### Screenshot

### Console Output

### Network Traffic

## [Use cases](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/browser\#use-cases)

### [Accessibility improvements](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/browser\#accessibility-improvements)

Agent can audit and improve web accessibility to meet WCAG compliance standards.

@browser Check color contrast ratios, verify semantic HTML and ARIA labels, test keyboard navigation, and identify missing alt text

[Cursor LogoTry in Cursor](cursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/prompt?text=%40browser+Check+color+contrast+ratios%2C+verify+semantic+HTML+and+ARIA+labels%2C+test+keyboard+navigation%2C+and+identify+missing+alt+text)

### [Automated testing](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/browser\#automated-testing)

Agent can execute comprehensive test suites and capture screenshots for visual regression testing.

@browser Fill out forms with test data, click through workflows, test responsive designs, validate error messages, and monitor console for JavaScript errors

[Cursor LogoTry in Cursor](cursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/prompt?text=%40browser+Fill+out+forms+with+test+data%2C+click+through+workflows%2C+test+responsive+designs%2C+validate+error+messages%2C+and+monitor+console+for+JavaScript+errors)

### [Design to code](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/browser\#design-to-code)

Agent can convert designs into working code with responsive layouts.

@browser Analyze this design mockup, extract colors and typography, and generate pixel-perfect HTML and CSS code

[Cursor LogoTry in Cursor](cursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/prompt?text=%40browser+Analyze+this+design+mockup%2C+extract+colors+and+typography%2C+and+generate+pixel-perfect+HTML+and+CSS+code)

### [Adjusting UI design from screenshots](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/browser\#adjusting-ui-design-from-screenshots)

Agent can refine existing interfaces by identifying visual discrepancies and updating component styles.

@browser Compare current UI against this design screenshot and adjust spacing, colors, and typography to match

[Cursor LogoTry in Cursor](cursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/prompt?text=%40browser+Compare+current+UI+against+this+design+screenshot+and+adjust+spacing%2C+colors%2C+and+typography+to+match)

## [Security](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/browser\#security)

Browser runs as a secure web view, operating like an MCP server extension. Multiple layers protect you from unauthorized access and malicious actions.

While in beta, we welcome feedback on additional security features you would like to see.

### [Authentication and isolation](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/browser\#authentication-and-isolation)

The browser implements several security measures:

- **Token authentication**: Agent layout generates a random authentication token before each browser session starts
- **Tab isolation**: Each browser tab receives a unique random ID to prevent cross-tab interference
- **Session-based security**: Tokens regenerate for each new browser session

### [Tool approval](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/browser\#tool-approval)

Browser tools require your approval by default. Review each action before Agent executes it. This prevents unexpected navigation, data submission, or script execution.

You can configure approval settings in Agent Settings. Available modes:

| Mode | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Manual approval** | Review and approve each browser action individually (recommended) |
| **Allow-listed actions** | Actions matching your allow list run automatically; others require approval |
| **Auto-run** | All browser actions execute immediately without approval (use with caution) |

### [Allow and block lists](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/browser\#allow-and-block-lists)

Browser tools integrate with Cursor's [security guardrails](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/security). Configure which browser actions run automatically:

- **Allow list**: Specify trusted actions that skip approval prompts
- **Block list**: Define actions that should always be blocked
- Access settings through: `Cursor Settings` → `Chat` → `Auto-Run`

The allow/block list system provides best-effort protection. AI behavior can be unpredictable due to prompt injection and other issues. Review auto-approved actions regularly.

Never use auto-run mode with untrusted code or unfamiliar websites. Agent could execute malicious scripts or submit sensitive data without your knowledge.

### [Browser context](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/browser\#browser-context)

The browser window's behavior changes based on where you run it:

| Context | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| **Agent panel** | Opens in a separate window for full-screen browsing |
| **Agent layout** | Opens inline as a pane within Cursor |

Both contexts use identical security controls and authentication.

## [Recommended models](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/browser\#recommended-models)

We recommend using Sonnet 4.5 for browser use for the best performance. Auto and GPT-5 are also good options.

# Compliance and Monitoring

Compliance requires visibility into who did what, when, and why. This documentation covers audit logs, AI code tracking, certifications, and how to meet regulatory requirements.

## [Audit logs](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/compliance-and-monitoring\#audit-logs)

Audit logs provide a record of security events and administrative actions. Available on Enterprise plans, audit logs help you meet compliance requirements and investigate security incidents.

We log the following events:

- **Authentication events:** Logins and logouts
- **User management:** User additions (via SSO, invite, signup, team creation, or auto-enrollment), removals, role changes, and individual spend limits
- **API key management:** Team and user API key creation and revocation
- **Team settings:** Team-wide and per-user spending limits, admin settings, team name changes, Slack integration settings, and repository mappings
- **Repository management:** Repository creation, deletion, and settings updates
- **Directory groups:** Directory group creation, updates, deletion, membership changes, and permission modifications
- **Privacy settings:** Privacy Mode changes at user or team level
- **Team rules:** Team rule management (including Bugbot rules) for custom workflows
- **Team commands:** Custom command creation, updates, and deletion

We do not log agent responses or generated code content.

Instead, we recommend using [hooks](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/hooks) to log prompts and code.

### [Accessing audit logs](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/compliance-and-monitoring\#accessing-audit-logs)

View audit logs in the [team dashboard](https://cursor.com/dashboard?tab=audit-log). This is available on Enterprise plans, and requires admin access.

### [Streaming audit logs](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/compliance-and-monitoring\#streaming-audit-logs)

For compliance and security monitoring, stream audit logs to your existing systems:

- SIEM systems (Splunk, Sumo Logic, Datadog, etc.)
- Webhook endpoints for custom processing
- S3 buckets for long-term retention
- Log aggregators like Elasticsearch or CloudWatch

This can be configured in the [team dashboard](https://cursor.com/dashboard?tab=audit-log) under "Audit log settings".

### [Log format](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/compliance-and-monitoring\#log-format)

Audit logs are delivered as JSON and include metadata and event-specific fields:

```
{
  "metadata": {
    "timestamp": "2024-10-14T18:30:45Z",
    "event_id": "evt_abc123xyz789"

### [Searching and filtering](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/compliance-and-monitoring\#searching-and-filtering)

Filter audit logs in the dashboard by:

- Date range
- Event type (authentication, user management, settings)
- Actor (specific user)

Export filtered results to CSV for analysis or compliance reports.

## [Using hooks for compliance logging](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/compliance-and-monitoring\#using-hooks-for-compliance-logging)

Audit logs track administrative actions, but some compliance requirements need logging of development activity. Use hooks to log:

### [Prompts submitted hook](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/compliance-and-monitoring\#prompts-submitted-hook)

```
#!/bin/bash
input=$(cat)
prompt=$(echo "$input" | jq -r '.prompt')
user_id=$(echo "$input" | jq -r '.user_id')

# Log to your compliance system
curl -X POST "https://compliance.company.com/log" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"type\":\"prompt\",\"user\":\"$user_id\",\"timestamp\":\"$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\"}"

cat << EOF
{
  "continue": true
}
EOF
```

### [Code generated hook](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/compliance-and-monitoring\#code-generated-hook)

```
#!/bin/bash
input=$(cat)
file_path=$(echo "$input" | jq -r '.file_path')
edits=$(echo "$input" | jq -r '.edits')

# Log the code generation event (not the actual code)
curl -X POST "https://compliance.company.com/log" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"type\":\"generation\",\"file\":\"$file_path\",\"timestamp\":\"$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\"}"

exit 0
```

**Important:** Be careful logging actual code or prompts. They may contain sensitive information. Log metadata (who, when, what file) rather than content when possible.

See [Hooks](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/hooks) for hook implementation details.

## [Certifications and compliance](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/compliance-and-monitoring\#certifications-and-compliance)

Configuration

# Python

This guide was heavily inspired by [Jack Fields](https://x.com/OrdinaryInds)
and his
[article](https://medium.com/ordinaryindustries/the-ultimate-vs-code-setup-for-python-538026b34d94)
about setting up VS Code for Python development. Please check his article for
more details.

## [Prerequisites](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/languages/python\#prerequisites)

Before we begin, ensure you have:

- [Python](https://python.org/) installed (3.8 or higher recommended)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control
- Cursor installed and updated to the latest version

## [Essential Extensions](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/languages/python\#essential-extensions)

The following extensions setup Cursor to be fully featured for Python development. These provide you with syntax highlighting, linting, debugging and unit testing.

- [**Python**](cursor:extension/ms-python.python) (Core language support from Microsoft)
- [**Cursor Pyright**](cursor:extension/anysphere.cursorpyright) (Fast Python language server)
- [**Python Debugger**](cursor:extension/ms-python.debugpy) (Enhanced debugging capabilities)
- [**Ruff**](cursor:extension/charliermarsh.ruff) (Python linter and formatter)

### [Advanced Python Tooling](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/languages/python\#advanced-python-tooling)

While the above extensions have previously been the most popular extensions for Python development in Cursor, we've also added some additional extensions that can help you get the most out of your Python development.

#### [`uv` \- Python Environment Manager](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/languages/python\#uv-python-environment-manager)

[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is a modern Python package manager that can be used to create and manage virtual environments, in addition to replacing pip as the default package manager.

To install uv, run the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install uv
```

#### [`ruff` \- Python Linter and Formatter](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/languages/python\#ruff-python-linter-and-formatter)

[Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) is a modern Python linter and formatter that can be used to check for programming errors, helps enforce coding standards, and can suggest refactoring. It can be used alongside Black for code formatting.

To install Ruff, run the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install ruff
```

## [Cursor Configuration](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/languages/python\#cursor-configuration)

### [1\. Python Interpreter](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/languages/python\#1-python-interpreter)

Configure your Python interpreter in Cursor:

1. Open Command Palette (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P)
2. Search for "Python: Select Interpreter"
3. Choose your Python interpreter (or virtual environment if you're using one)

### [2\. Code Formatting](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/languages/python\#2-code-formatting)

Set up automatic code formatting with Black:

Black is a code formatter that automatically formats your code to follow a
consistent style. It requires zero configuration and is widely adopted in the
Python community.

To install Black, run the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install black
```

Then, configure Cursor to use Black for code formatting, by adding the following to your `settings.json` file:

```
{
  "python.formatting.provider": "black",
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "python.formatting.blackArgs": ["--line-length", "88"]
}
```

### [3\. Linting](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/languages/python\#3-linting)

We can use PyLint to check for programming errors, helps enforce coding standards, and can suggest refactoring.

To install PyLint, run the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install pylint
```

```
{
  "python.linting.enabled": true,
  "python.linting.pylintEnabled": true,
  "python.linting.lintOnSave": true
}
```

### [4\. Type Checking](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/languages/python\#4-type-checking)

In addition to linting, we can use MyPy to check for type errors.

To install MyPy, run the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install mypy
```

```
{
  "python.linting.mypyEnabled": true
}
```

# Background Agents API

The Background Agents API (Beta) allows you to programmatically create and manage AI-powered coding agents that work autonomously on your repositories.
You can use the API to automatically respond to user feedback, fix bugs, update docs, and much more.

Background Agents API is currently in beta, we'd love your feedback on it!

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is not yet supported by the Background Agents API.

## [Key features](https://cursor.com/docs/background-agent/api/overview\#key-features)

- **Autonomous code generation** \- Create agents that can understand your prompt and make changes to your codebase
- **Repository integration** \- Work directly with GitHub repositories
- **Follow-up prompts** \- Add additional instructions to running agents
- **Usage-based pricing** \- Pay only for the tokens you use
- **Scalable** \- Support for up to 256 active agents per API key

## [Quick start](https://cursor.com/docs/background-agent/api/overview\#quick-start)

# Terminal

Agent runs shell commands directly in your terminal, with safe sandbox execution for macOS users. Command history persists across sessions. Click skip to interrupt running commands with `Ctrl+C`.

## [Sandbox](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/terminal\#sandbox)

Sandbox is currently available on macOS only. Linux support is coming soon. Windows users can use WSL or devcontainers for sandboxed command execution.

By default, Agent runs terminal commands in a restricted environment that blocks unauthorized file access and network activity. Commands execute automatically while staying confined to your workspace. On macOS, this is implemented using `sandbox-exec`.

### [How the sandbox works](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/terminal\#how-the-sandbox-works)

The sandbox prevents unauthorized access while allowing workspace operations:

| Access Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **File access** | Read and write access limited to workspace directories |
| **Network access** | Blocked by default (configurable in settings) |
| **Temporary files** | Full access to `/tmp/` or equivalent system temp directories |

The `.cursor` configuration directory stays protected regardless of allowlist settings.

### [Allowlist](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/terminal\#allowlist)

Commands on the allowlist skip sandbox restrictions and run immediately. You can add commands to the allowlist by choosing "Add to allowlist" when prompted after a sandboxed command fails.

When a sandboxed command fails due to restrictions, you can:

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Skip** | Cancel the command and let Agent try something else |
| **Run** | Execute the command without sandbox restrictions |
| **Add to allowlist** | Run without restrictions and automatically approve it for future use |

## [Editor Configuration](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/terminal\#editor-configuration)

Configure how Agent runs terminal commands in the editor by navigating to Settings -> Cursor Settings -> Agents -> Auto-Run.

| Editor Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Auto-Run Mode** | Choose how Agent runs tools like command execution, MCP, and file writes. Users can select from three options: <br>• **Run in Sandbox**: Tools and commands will auto-run in sandbox where possible. Available on macOS only. <br>• **Ask Every Time**: All tools and commands require user approval before running. <br>• **Run Everything**: The agent runs all tools and commands automatically without asking for user input. |
| **Auto-Run Network Access** | Choose whether commands that run in the sandbox have network access. |
| **Allow Git Writes Without Approval** | When enabled, git write operations (commit, push, etc.) run without approval in the sandbox. When disabled, they require approval. Note that git push and similar actions will require network access to run. |
| **Command Allowlist** | Commands that can run automatically outside of the sandbox. |
| **MCP Allowlist** | MCP tools that can run automatically outside of the sandbox. |
| **Browser Protection** | Prevent Agent from automatically running [Browser](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/browser) tools. |
| **File-Deletion Protection** | Prevent Agent from deleting files automatically. |
| **Dotfile Protection** | Prevent Agent from modifying dot files like .gitignore automatically. |
| **External-File Protection** | Prevent Agent from creating or modifying files outside of the workspace automatically. |

## [Enterprise Controls](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/terminal\#enterprise-controls)

Only available for Enterprise subscriptions.

Enterprise admins can override editor configurations or change which settings are visible for end users. Navigate to Settings -> Auto-Run in the [web dashboard](https://cursor.com/dashboard?tab=settings) to view and change these settings.

| Admin Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Auto-Run Controls** | Enable controls for auto-run and sandbox mode. If disabled, the default behavior for all end users is that commands will auto-run in the sandbox when available, otherwise they will ask for permission to run. |
| **Sandboxing Mode** | Control whether sandbox is available for end users. When enabled, commands will run automatically in the sandbox even if they are not on the allowlist. |
| **Sandbox Networking** | Choose whether commands that run in the sandbox have network access. |
| **Sandbox Git Access** | When enabled, git write operations (commit, push, etc.) run without approval in the sandbox. When disabled, they require approval. Note that git push and similar actions will require network access to run. |
| **Delete File Protection** | Prevent Agent from deleting files automatically. |
| **MCP Tool Protection** | When enabled, prevents the agent from automatically running MCP tools. |
| **Terminal Command Allowlist** | Specify which terminal commands can run automatically without sandboxing. If empty, all commands require manual approval. When sandbox is enabled, commands not on this list will auto-run in sandbox mode. |
| **Enable Run Everything** | Give end users the ability to enable the `Run Everything` Auto-Run-Mode. |

## [Troubleshooting](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/terminal\#troubleshooting)

Some shell themes (for example, Powerlevel9k/Powerlevel10k) can interfere with
the inline terminal output. If your command output looks truncated or
misformatted, disable the theme or switch to a simpler prompt when Agent runs.

### [Disable heavy prompts for Agent sessions](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/terminal\#disable-heavy-prompts-for-agent-sessions)

Use the `CURSOR_AGENT` environment variable in your shell config to detect when
the Agent is running and skip initializing fancy prompts/themes.

```
# ~/.zshrc — disable Powerlevel10k when Cursor Agent runs
if [[ -n "$CURSOR_AGENT" ]]; then
  # Skip theme initialization for better compatibility
else
  [[ -r ~/.p10k.zsh ]] && source ~/.p10k.zsh
fi
```

```
# ~/.bashrc — fall back to a simple prompt in Agent sessions
if [[ -n "$CURSOR_AGENT" ]]; then
  PS1='\u@\h \W \$ '
fi
```

# Shell Mode

Shell Mode runs shell commands directly from the CLI without leaving your conversation. Use it for quick, non-interactive commands with safety checks and output displayed in the conversation.

## [Command execution](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/shell-mode\#command-execution)

Commands run in your login shell ( `$SHELL`) with the CLI's working directory and environment. Chain commands to run in other directories:

```
cd subdir && npm test
```

## [Output](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/shell-mode\#output)

Large outputs are truncated automatically and long-running processes timeout to maintain performance.

## [Limitations](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/shell-mode\#limitations)

- Commands timeout after 30 seconds
- Long-running processes, servers, and interactive prompts are not supported
- Use short, non-interactive commands for best results

## [Permissions](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/shell-mode\#permissions)

Commands are checked against your permissions and team settings before execution. See [Permissions](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/reference/permissions) for detailed configuration.

Admin policies may block certain commands, and commands with redirection cannot be allowlisted inline.

## [Usage guidelines](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/shell-mode\#usage-guidelines)

Shell Mode works well for status checks, quick builds, file operations, and environment inspection.

Avoid long-running servers, interactive applications, and commands requiring input.

Each command runs independently - use `cd <dir> && ...` to run commands in other directories.

## [Troubleshooting](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/shell-mode\#troubleshooting)

- If a command hangs, cancel with `Ctrl+C` and add non-interactive flags
- When prompted for permissions, approve once or add to allowlist with `Tab`
- For truncated output, use `Ctrl+O` to expand
- To run in different directories, use `cd <dir> && ...` since changes don't persist
- Shell Mode supports zsh and bash from your `$SHELL` variable

## [FAQ](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/shell-mode\#faq)

### Does \`cd\` persist across runs?

### Can I change the timeout?

### Where are permissions configured?

### How do I exit Shell Mode?

# MCP

## [Overview](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/mcp\#overview)

The Cursor CLI supports [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://cursor.com/docs/context/mcp) servers, allowing you to connect external tools and data sources to `cursor-agent`. **MCP in the CLI uses the same configuration as the editor** \- any MCP servers you've configured will work with both.

available servers](https://cursor.com/docs/context/mcp)

## [CLI commands](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/mcp\#cli-commands)

Use the `cursor-agent mcp` command to manage MCP servers

### [List configured servers](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/mcp\#list-configured-servers)

View all configured MCP servers and their current status:

```
cursor-agent mcp list
```

This shows:

- Server names and identifiers
- Connection status (connected/disconnected)
- Configuration source (project or global)
- Transport method (stdio, HTTP, SSE)

### [List available tools](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/mcp\#list-available-tools)

View tools provided by a specific MCP server:

```
cursor-agent mcp list-tools <identifier>
```

This displays:

- Tool names and descriptions
- Required and optional parameters
- Parameter types and constraints

### [Login to MCP server](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/mcp\#login-to-mcp-server)

Authenticate with an MCP server configured in your `mcp.json`:

```
cursor-agent mcp login <identifier>
```

### [Disable MCP server](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/mcp\#disable-mcp-server)

Remove an MCP server from the local approved list:

```
cursor-agent mcp disable <identifier>
```

## [Using MCP with Agent](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/mcp\#using-mcp-with-agent)

Once you have MCP servers configured (see the [main MCP guide](https://cursor.com/docs/context/mcp) for setup), `cursor-agent` automatically discovers and uses available tools when relevant to your requests.

```
# Check what MCP servers are available
cursor-agent mcp list

# See what tools a specific server provides
cursor-agent mcp list-tools playwright

# Use cursor-agent - it automatically uses MCP tools when helpful
cursor-agent --prompt "Navigate to google.com and take a screenshot of the search page"
```

The CLI follows the same configuration precedence as the editor (project → global → nested), automatically discovering configurations from parent directories.

# Analytics

Team admins can track metrics from the [dashboard](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/dashboard).

![Team analytics](https://cursor.com/docs-static/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs-static%2Fimages%2Faccount%2Fteam%2Fanalytics.png&w=1920&q=75)

### [Total Usage](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/analytics\#total-usage)

View aggregate metrics across your team, including total tabs and premium requests. For teams under 30 days old, metrics reflect usage since creation, including team members' pre-join activity.

### [Per Active User](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/analytics\#per-active-user)

See average metrics per active user: tabs accepted, lines of code, and premium requests.

### [User Activity](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/analytics\#user-activity)

Track weekly and monthly active users.

## [Analytics Report Headers](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/analytics\#analytics-report-headers)

When you export analytics data from the dashboard, the report includes detailed metrics about user behavior and feature usage. Here's what each header means:

### [Calculated Metrics](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/analytics\#calculated-metrics)

The report also includes processed data that helps understand AI code contribution:

- **Total Lines Added/Deleted**: Raw count of all code changes
- **Accepted Lines Added/Deleted**: Lines that originated from AI suggestions and were accepted
- **Composer Requests**: Requests made through the inline composer feature
- **Chat Requests**: Requests made through the chat interface

All numeric values default to 0 if not present, boolean values default to
false, and string values default to empty strings. Metrics are aggregated at
the daily level per user.

Get Started

# Quickstart

This quickstart will walk you through a project using Cursor's core features. By the end, you'll be familiar with Tab, Inline Edit, and Agent.

[Download Cursor⤓](https://cursor.com/downloads)

## [Open a project in Cursor](https://cursor.com/docs/get-started/quickstart\#open-a-project-in-cursor)

Use an existing project or clone our example:

Clone example projectUse existing project

1. Ensure git is installed
2. Clone the example project:

```
git clone git@github.com:voxelize/voxelize.git && \
cd voxelize && \
cursor .
```

We'll be showcasing using the example project, but you can use any project you have locally.

## [Autocomplete with Tab](https://cursor.com/docs/get-started/quickstart\#autocomplete-with-tab)

[Tab](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/kbd#tab) is the autocomplete model we've trained in-house. It's a great way to ease into AI assisted coding if you're not used to it. With Tab, you can:

- Autocomplete **multiple lines and blocks** of code
- Jump **in** and **across** files to the next autocomplete suggestion

Let's try it out:

1. Start typing the beginning of a function: `function calculate`
2. Tab suggestions appear automatically
3. Press Tab to accept the suggestion
4. Cursor suggests parameters and function bodies

## [Inline Edit a selection](https://cursor.com/docs/get-started/quickstart\#inline-edit-a-selection)

1. Select the function you just created
2. Press `Cmd K`
3. Type "make this function calculate fibonacci numbers"
4. Press `Return` to apply the changes
5. Cursor adds imports and documentation

## [Chat with Agent](https://cursor.com/docs/get-started/quickstart\#chat-with-agent)

1. Open the Chat panel ( `Cmd I`)
2. Ask: "Add tests for this function and run them"

# Admin API

The Admin API lets you programmatically access your team's data, including member information, usage metrics, and spending details. Build custom dashboards, monitoring tools, or integrate with existing workflows.

The API is in its first release. We're expanding capabilities based on
feedback - let us know what endpoints you need!

## [Authentication](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/admin-api\#authentication)

All API requests require authentication using an API key. Only team administrators can create and manage API keys.

API keys are tied to the organization, viewable by all admins, and are unaffected by the original creator's account status.

### [Creating an API Key](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/admin-api\#creating-an-api-key)

1. Navigate to **cursor.com/dashboard** → **Settings** tab → **Advanced** → **Admin API Keys**
2. Click **Create New API Key**
3. Give your key a descriptive name (e.g., "Usage Dashboard Integration")
4. Copy the generated key immediately - you won't see it again

Format: `key_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

### [Using Your API Key](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/admin-api\#using-your-api-key)

Use your API key as the username in basic authentication:

**Using curl with basic auth:**

```
curl https://api.cursor.com/{route} -u API_KEY:
```

**Or set the Authorization header directly:**

```
Authorization: Basic {base64_encode('API_KEY:')}
```

## [Base URL](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/admin-api\#base-url)

All API endpoints use:

```
https://api.cursor.com
```

## [Rate Limits](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/admin-api\#rate-limits)

API requests are rate limited **per team** per endpoint to ensure platform stability. Rate limits apply to the team associated with your API key.

### [Rate-Limited Endpoints](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/admin-api\#rate-limited-endpoints)

| Endpoint(s) | Rate Limit | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /teams/daily-usage-data` | 20 requests per minute | Team usage analytics |
| `POST /teams/filtered-usage-events` | 20 requests per minute | Team usage events |
| `POST /teams/usage` | 20 requests per minute | Team usage data |
| `POST /teams/user-spend-limit` | 60 requests per minute | User spend limit management |
| `GET /analytics/ai-code/commits` | 20 requests per minute | AI code analytics (Enterprise) |
| `GET /analytics/ai-code/commits.csv` | 20 requests per minute | AI code analytics (Enterprise) |
| `GET /analytics/ai-code/changes` | 20 requests per minute | AI code analytics (Enterprise) |
| `GET /analytics/ai-code/changes.csv` | 20 requests per minute | AI code analytics (Enterprise) |

### [Rate Limit Behavior](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/admin-api\#rate-limit-behavior)

- **Scope**: Rate limits apply per team, not per user or API key
- **Response**: When exceeded, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response
- **Reset**: Rate limits reset every minute
- **Recommendation**: Implement exponential backoff when rate limits are hit

### [Usage Data Aggregation](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/admin-api\#usage-data-aggregation)

**Important**: All usage-related APIs aggregate data at the **hourly level**. This includes:

- `POST /teams/daily-usage-data`
- `POST /teams/filtered-usage-events`
- `POST /teams/usage`

We recommend polling the endpoints at most once per hour.

# Compact

Compact mode provides a streamlined chat interface by reducing visual clutter and maximizing available space for conversations.

## [Overview](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/chat/compact\#overview)

When enabled, compact mode transforms the chat interface by:

- **Hiding icons** for a cleaner, minimalist appearance
- **Auto-collapsing diffs** to reduce visual noise
- **Auto-collapsing input** to maximize conversation space

This setting is particularly useful when working on smaller screens or when you prefer a focused, distraction-free chat experience.

## [Before and After](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/chat/compact\#before-and-after)

### [Default mode](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/chat/compact\#default-mode)

![Chat interface in default mode showing all icons and expanded elements](https://cursor.com/docs-static/images/chat/compact/off.png)

### [Compact mode](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/chat/compact\#compact-mode)

![Chat interface in compact mode with hidden icons and collapsed elements](https://cursor.com/docs-static/images/chat/compact/on.png)

## [Enabling compact mode](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/chat/compact\#enabling-compact-mode)

To enable compact mode:

1. Open Cursor Settings
2. Navigate to **Chat** settings
3. Toggle **Compact Mode** to enable

The interface will immediately update to the streamlined view, giving you more space to focus on your conversations.

Troubleshooting

# Common Issues

Below are common issues and their solutions.

### [Networking Issues](https://cursor.com/docs/troubleshooting/common-issues\#networking-issues)

First, check your network connectivity. Go to `Cursor Settings` \> `Network` and click `Run Diagnostics`. This will test your connection to Cursor's servers and help identify any network-related issues that might be affecting AI features, updates, or other online functionality.

Cursor relies on HTTP/2 for AI features because it handles streamed responses efficiently. If your network doesn't support HTTP/2, you may experience indexing failures and AI feature issues.

This occurs on corporate networks, VPNs, or when using proxies like Zscaler.

To resolve this, enable HTTP/1.1 fallback in app settings (not Cursor settings): press `CMD/CTRL + ,`, search for `HTTP/2`, then enable `Disable HTTP/2`. This forces HTTP/1.1 usage and resolves the issue.

We plan to add automatic detection and fallback.

### [Resource Issues (CPU, RAM, etc.)](https://cursor.com/docs/troubleshooting/common-issues\#resource-issues-cpu-ram-etc)

High CPU or RAM usage can slow your machine or trigger resource warnings.

While large codebases require more resources, high usage typically stems from extensions or settings issues.

If you are seeing a low RAM warning on **MacOS**, please note that there is a
bug for some users that can show wildly incorrect values. If you are seeing
this, please open the Activity Monitor and look at the "Memory" tab to see the
correct memory usage.

If you're experiencing high CPU or RAM usage, try these steps:

### Check Your Extensions

### Use the Process Explorer

### Monitor System Resources

### Testing a Minimal Installation

## [AI Model Issues](https://cursor.com/docs/troubleshooting/common-issues\#ai-model-issues)

If you're experiencing unexpected AI behavior, understanding [how AI models work](https://cursor.com/learn/how-ai-models-work) and [their limitations](https://cursor.com/learn/hallucination-limitations) can help you work more effectively with Cursor's AI features.

## [General FAQs](https://cursor.com/docs/troubleshooting/common-issues\#general-faqs)

### I see an update on the changelog but Cursor won't update

### I have issues with my GitHub login in Cursor / How do I log out of GitHub in Cursor?

### I can't use GitHub Codespaces

### I have errors connecting to Remote SSH

### SSH Connection Problems on Windows

# Regions

Some of our model providers have location-based restrictions, which means certain models may not be available in your region. When this happens, those models won’t appear in Cursor, but you’ll still be able to use all other available models without interruption.

If you recently paid for a Cursor plan and lost access to certain models because the provider does not support your region, you can request a pro‑rated refund directly in the Cursor dashboard. See Refunds below for step‑by‑step instructions.

## [What you can do today](https://cursor.com/docs/account/regions\#what-you-can-do-today)

1. Continue using Cursor with available models. The [Auto](https://cursor.com/docs/models) option will choose an available model for each request.
2. Manually select any model that remains enabled in your account.
3. Bring your own API key (where supported) for a provider that serves your region. See [API Keys](https://cursor.com/docs/settings/api-keys).
4. Request account cancellation with a pro‑rated refund if provider coverage materially reduces the value of your paid plan.

## [Refunds](https://cursor.com/docs/account/regions\#refunds)

Affected users will see a "Request Refund" option on the [Cursor billing dashboard](https://cursor.com/dashboard?tab=billing).

1. Open the [Cursor dashboard](https://cursor.com/dashboard).
2. Click Billing (or Billing & Invoices, depending on plan).
3. Select Request refund.

Refund processing times vary by payment method. Refunds post to your original
payment source.

## [FAQ](https://cursor.com/docs/account/regions\#faq)

### Why does model availability vary?

### Which regions are supported by each provider?

### Can I use other models?

### Can I bring my own model?

### How do refunds work?

# Hooks

Hooks let you observe, control, and extend the agent loop using custom scripts. Hooks are spawned processes that communicate over stdio using JSON in both directions. They run before or after defined stages of the agent loop and can observe, block, or modify behavior.

With hooks, you can:

- Run formatters after edits
- Add analytics for events
- Scan for PII or secrets
- Gate risky operations (e.g., SQL writes)

## [Quickstart](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/hooks\#quickstart)

Create a `hooks.json` file in your home directory at `~/.cursor/hooks.json`

```
{
  "version": 1,
  "hooks": {
    "afterFileEdit": [\
      { "command": "./hooks/format.sh" }\
    ]
  }
}
```

Create your hook script at `~/.cursor/hooks/format.sh`:

```
#!/bin/bash
# Read input, do something, exit 0
cat > /dev/null
exit 0
```

Make it executable:

```
chmod +x ~/.cursor/hooks/format.sh
```

Restart Cursor. Your hook now runs after every file edit.

## [Examples](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/hooks\#examples)

hooks.jsonaudit.shblock-git.shredact-secrets.sh

```
{
  "version": 1,
  "hooks": {
    "beforeShellExecution": [\
      {\
        "command": "./hooks/audit.sh"\
      },\
      {\
        "command": "./hooks/block-git.sh"\
      }\
    ],
    "beforeMCPExecution": [\
      {\
        "command": "./hooks/audit.sh"\
      }\
    ],
    "beforeReadFile": [\
      {\
        "command": "./hooks/redact-secrets.sh"\
      }\
    ],
    "afterFileEdit": [\
      {\
        "command": "./hooks/audit.sh"\
      }\
    ],
    "beforeSubmitPrompt": [\
      {\
        "command": "./hooks/audit.sh"\
      }\
    ],
    "stop": [\
      {\
        "command": "./hooks/audit.sh"\
      }\
    ]
  }
}
```

## [Configuration](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/hooks\#configuration)

Define hooks in a `hooks.json` file. Configuration can exist at multiple levels; higher-priority sources override lower ones:

```
~/.cursor/
├── hooks.json
└── hooks/
    ├── audit.sh
    ├── block-git.sh
    └── redact-secrets.sh
```

- Home Directory (User-specific):
  - `~/.cursor/hooks.json`
- Global (Enterprise-managed):
  - macOS: `/Library/Application Support/Cursor/hooks.json`
  - Linux/WSL: `/etc/cursor/hooks.json`
  - Windows: `C:\\ProgramData\\Cursor\\hooks.json`

The `hooks` object maps hook names to arrays of hook definitions. Each definition currently supports a `command` property that can be a shell string, an absolute path, or a path relative to the `hooks.json` file.

### [Configuration file](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/hooks\#configuration-file)

```
{
  "version": 1,
  "hooks": {
    "beforeShellExecution": [\
      { "command": "./script.sh" }\
    ],
    "afterFileEdit": [\
      { "command": "./format.sh" }\
    ]
  }
}
```

## [Reference](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/hooks\#reference)

### [Common schema](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/hooks\#common-schema)

#### [Input (all hooks)](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/hooks\#input-all-hooks)

{ "command": "<command string>" }

// Output
{
  "permission": "allow" | "deny" | "ask",
  "userMessage": "<message shown in client>",
  "agentMessage": "<message sent to agent>"
}
```

#### [afterFileEdit](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/hooks\#afterfileedit)

Fires after a file is edited; useful for formatters or accounting of agent-written code.

```
// Input
{
  "file_path": "<absolute path>",
  "edits": [\
    { "old_string": "<search>", "new_string": "<replace>" }\
  ]
}
```

#### [beforeReadFile](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/hooks\#beforereadfile)

Enable redaction or access control before the agent reads a file. Includes any prompt attachments for auditing rules inclusion.

```
// Input
{
  "file_path": "<absolute path>",
  "content": "<file contents>",
  "attachments": [\
    {\
      "type": "rule",\
      "file_path": "<absolute path>"\
    }\
  ]
}

// Output
{
  "permission": "allow" | "deny"
}
```

#### [beforeSubmitPrompt](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/hooks\#beforesubmitprompt)

Called right after user hits send but before backend request. Can prevent submission.

```
// Input
{
  "prompt": "<user prompt text>",
  "attachments": [\
    {\
      "type": "file" | "rule",\
      "file_path": "<absolute path>"\
    }\
  ]
}

// Output
{
  "continue": true | false
}
```

#### [stop](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/hooks\#stop)

Called when the agent loop ends.

```
// Input
{ "status": "completed" | "aborted" | "error" }
```

## [Troubleshooting](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/hooks\#troubleshooting)

**I'm on SSH, how do I use hooks?**

Remote SSH is not yet supported

**How to confirm hooks are active**

There is a Hooks tab in Cursor Settings to debug configured and executed hooks, as well as a Hooks output channel to see errors.

**If hooks are not working**

- Restart Cursor to ensure the hooks service is running.
- Ensure hook script paths are relative to `hooks.json` when using relative paths.

# Background Agents

With background agents, spawn asynchronous agents that edit and run code in a remote environment. View their status, send follow-ups, or take over anytime.

Background agents leverage the same [agent fundamentals](https://cursor.com/learn/agents) but run autonomously in isolated environments.

## [How to Use](https://cursor.com/docs/background-agent\#how-to-use)

You can access background agents in two ways:

1. **Background Agent Sidebar**: Use the background agent tab in the native Cursor sidebar to view all background agents associated with your account, search existing agents, and start new ones.
2. **Background Agent Mode**: Hit `Cmd E` to trigger background agent mode in the UI.

After submitting a prompt, select your agent from the list to view status and enter the machine.

Background agents require data retention on the order of a few days.

## [Setup](https://cursor.com/docs/background-agent\#setup)

Background agents run in an isolated ubuntu-based machine by default. Agents have internet access and can install packages.

#### [GitHub connection](https://cursor.com/docs/background-agent\#github-connection)

Background agents clone your repo from GitHub and work on a separate branch, pushing to your repo for easy handoff.

Grant read-write privileges to your repo (and any dependent repos or submodules). We'll support other providers (GitLab, BitBucket, etc) in the future.

#### [Base Environment Setup](https://cursor.com/docs/background-agent\#base-environment-setup)

You can view your environment configuration within Cursor by visiting the [Cursor Settings](cursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/settings) → `Background Agents` tab, or start the setup process by running `Cursor: Start Background Agent Setup` in the command palette.

For advanced cases, set up the environment yourself. Get an IDE instance connected to the remote machine. Set up your machine, install tools and packages, then take a snapshot. Configure runtime settings:

- Install command runs before an agent starts and installs runtime dependencies. This might mean running `npm install` or `bazel build`.
- Terminals run background processes while the agent works - like starting a web server or compiling protobuf files.

For the most advanced cases, use a Dockerfile for machine setup. The dockerfile lets you set up system-level dependencies: install specific compiler versions, debuggers, or switch the base OS image. Don't `COPY` the entire project - we manage the workspace and check out the correct commit. Still handle dependency installation in the install script.

Enter any required secrets for your dev environment - they're stored encrypted-at-rest (using KMS) in our database and provided in the background agent environment.

The machine setup lives in `.cursor/environment.json`, which can be committed in your repo (recommended) or stored privately. The setup flow guides you through creating `environment.json`.

#### [Maintenance Commands](https://cursor.com/docs/background-agent\#maintenance-commands)

When setting up a new machine, we start from the base environment, then run the `install` command from your `environment.json`. This command is what a developer would run when switching branches - install any new dependencies.

For most people, the `install` command is `npm install` or `bazel build`.

To ensure fast machine startup, we cache disk state after the `install` command runs. Design it to run multiple times. Only disk state persists from the `install` command - processes started here won't be alive when the agent starts.

#### [Startup Commands](https://cursor.com/docs/background-agent\#startup-commands)

After running `install`, the machine starts and we run the `start` command followed by starting any `terminals`. This starts processes that should be alive when the agent runs.

The `start` command can often be skipped. Use it if your dev environment relies on docker - put `sudo service docker start` in the `start` command.

`terminals` are for app code. These terminals run in a `tmux` session available to you and the agent. For example, many website repos put `npm run watch` as a terminal.

#### [The `environment.json` Spec](https://cursor.com/docs/background-agent\#the-environmentjson-spec)

The `environment.json` file can look like:

```
{
  "snapshot": "POPULATED_FROM_SETTINGS",
  "install": "npm install",
  "terminals": [\
    {\
      "name": "Run Next.js",\
      "command": "npm run dev"\
    }\
  ]
}
```

Formally, the spec is [defined here](https://www.cursor.com/schemas/environment.schema.json).

#### [Using AWS IAM Roles](https://cursor.com/docs/background-agent\#using-aws-iam-roles)

Cursor supports assuming customer-provided IAM roles for deeper integration with AWS. This allows you to grant specific AWS permissions to background agents without sharing long-lived credentials.

1. **Create the IAM role**: In your AWS account, create the IAM role that you'd like the background agent to assume, and note its ARN (e.g. `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/acmeRole`).

2. **Configure the IAM role secret**: Navigate to [Cursor Dashboard → Background Agents](https://cursor.com/dashboard?tab=background-agents), and add a user or team secret named `CURSOR_AWS_ASSUME_IAM_ROLE_ARN` set to the ARN of the IAM role you just created.

3. **Generate an external ID**: Navigate to [Cursor Dashboard → Settings](https://cursor.com/dashboard?tab=settings) and find the External ID settings. If you don't see an external ID displayed, enter a placeholder value in the "AWS IAM Role ARN" field, click "Validate & Save", and reload the page - this will generate an external ID for your team (e.g. `cursor-xxx-yyy-zzz`).

4. **Configure IAM role trust policy**: In your AWS account, update the IAM role's trust policy to trust Cursor's role assumer. The trust policy should look like this:


```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [\
    {\
      "Sid": "AllowCursorAssume",\
      "Effect": "Allow",\
      "Principal": {\
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::289469326074:role/roleAssumer"\
      },\
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",\
      "Condition": {\
        "StringEquals": {\
          "sts:ExternalId": "cursor-xxx-yyy-zzz"\
        }\
      }\
    }\
  ]
}
```

Replace `cursor-xxx-yyy-zzz` with the external ID generated for your team.

**Environment Variables:**

When configured, the following AWS environment variables are set in the background agent's environment:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`

The AWS CLI and AWS SDKs should automatically pick up the environment variables.

Due to AWS constraints with role chaining, the assumed credentials expire
after 1 hour.

## [Models](https://cursor.com/docs/background-agent\#models)

Only [Max Mode](https://cursor.com/docs/context/max-mode)-compatible models are available for background agents.

## [Pricing](https://cursor.com/docs/background-agent\#pricing)

Learn more about [Background Agent pricing](https://cursor.com/docs/account/pricing#background-agent).

## [Security](https://cursor.com/docs/background-agent\#security)

Background Agents are available in Privacy Mode. We never train on your code and only retain code for running the agent. [Learn more about Privacy mode](https://www.cursor.com/privacy-overview).

What you should know:

1. Grant read-write privileges to our GitHub app for repos you want to edit. We use this to clone the repo and make changes.
2. Your code runs inside our AWS infrastructure in isolated VMs and is stored on VM disks while the agent is accessible.
3. The agent has internet access.
4. The agent auto-runs all terminal commands, letting it iterate on tests. This differs from the foreground agent, which requires user approval for every command. Auto-running introduces data exfiltration risk: attackers could execute prompt injection attacks, tricking the agent to upload code to malicious websites. See [OpenAI's explanation about risks of prompt injection for background agents](https://platform.openai.com/docs/codex/agent-network#risks-of-agent-internet-access).
5. If privacy mode is disabled, we collect prompts and dev environments to improve the product.
6. If you disable privacy mode when starting a background agent, then enable it during the agent's run, the agent continues with privacy mode disabled until it completes.

## [Dashboard settings](https://cursor.com/docs/background-agent\#dashboard-settings)

Workspace admins can configure additional settings from the Background Agents tab on the dashboard.

### [Defaults Settings](https://cursor.com/docs/background-agent\#defaults-settings)

- **Default model** – the model used when a run does not specify one. Pick any model that supports Max Mode.
- **Default repository** – when empty, agents ask the user to choose a repo. Supplying a repo here lets users skip that step.
- **Base branch** – the branch agents fork from when creating pull requests. Leave blank to use the repository’s default branch.

### [Security Settings](https://cursor.com/docs/background-agent\#security-settings)

All security options require admin privileges.

- **User restrictions** – choose _None_ (all members can start background agents) or _Allow list_. When set to _Allow list_ you specify exactly which teammates can create agents.
- **Team follow-ups** – when on, anyone in the workspace can add follow-up messages to an agent someone else started. Turn it off to restrict follow-ups to the agent owner and admins.
- **Display agent summary** – controls whether Cursor shows the agent’s file-diff images and code snippets. Disable this if you prefer not to expose file paths or code in the sidebar.
- **Display agent summary in external channels** – extends the previous toggle to Slack or any external channel you’ve connected.

Changes save instantly and affect new agents immediately.

# Using Headless CLI

Use Cursor CLI in scripts and automation workflows for code analysis, generation, and refactoring tasks.

## [How it works](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/headless\#how-it-works)

Use [print mode](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/using#non-interactive-mode) ( `-p, --print`) for non-interactive scripting and automation.

### [File modification in scripts](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/headless\#file-modification-in-scripts)

Combine `--print` with `--force` to modify files in scripts:

```
# Enable file modifications in print mode
cursor-agent -p --force "Refactor this code to use modern ES6+ syntax"

# Without --force, changes are only proposed, not applied
cursor-agent -p "Add JSDoc comments to this file"  # Won't modify files

# Batch processing with actual file changes
find src/ -name "*.js" | while read file; do
  cursor-agent -p --force "Add comprehensive JSDoc comments to $file"
done
```

The `--force` flag allows the agent to make direct file changes without
confirmation

## [Setup](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/headless\#setup)

See [Installation](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/installation) and [Authentication](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/reference/authentication) for complete setup details.

```
# Install Cursor CLI
curl https://cursor.com/install -fsS | bash

# Set API key for scripts
export CURSOR_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
cursor-agent -p "Analyze this code"
```

## [Example scripts](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/headless\#example-scripts)

Use different output formats for different script needs. See [Output format](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/reference/output-format) for details.

### [Searching the codebase](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/headless\#searching-the-codebase)

By default, `--print` uses `text` format for clean, final-answer-only responses:

```
#!/bin/bash
# Simple codebase question - uses text format by default

cursor-agent -p "What does this codebase do?"
```

### [Automated code review](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/headless\#automated-code-review)

Use `--output-format json` for structured analysis:

```
#!/bin/bash
# simple-code-review.sh - Basic code review script

echo "Starting code review..."

# Review recent changes
cursor-agent -p --force --output-format text \
  "Review the recent code changes and provide feedback on:
  - Code quality and readability
  - Potential bugs or issues
  - Security considerations
  - Best practices compliance

  Provide specific suggestions for improvement and write to review.txt"

if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "✅ Code review completed successfully"
else
  echo "❌ Code review failed"
  exit 1
fi
```

### [Real-time progress tracking](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/headless\#real-time-progress-tracking)

Use `--output-format stream-json` for message-level progress tracking, or add `--stream-partial-output` for incremental streaming of deltas:

```
#!/bin/bash
# stream-progress.sh - Track progress in real-time

echo "🚀 Starting stream processing..."

# Track progress in real-time
accumulated_text=""
tool_count=0
start_time=$(date +%s)

cursor-agent -p --force --output-format stream-json --stream-partial-output \
  "Analyze this project structure and create a summary report in analysis.txt" | \

# Troubleshooting Guide

Cursor issues can stem from extensions, app data, or system problems. Try these troubleshooting steps.

[Reporting an Issue\\
\\
Steps to report an issue to the Cursor team](https://cursor.com/docs/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-guide#reporting-an-issue)

## [Troubleshooting](https://cursor.com/docs/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-guide\#troubleshooting)

1

### Check network connectivity

First check if Cursor can connect to its services.

**Run network diagnostics:** Go to `Cursor Settings` \> `Network` and click `Run Diagnostics`. This tests your connection to Cursor's servers and identifies network issues affecting AI features, updates, or other online functionality.

If diagnostics reveal connectivity issues, check firewall settings, proxy configuration, or network restrictions blocking Cursor's access.

2

### Clearing extension data

For extension issues:

**Disable all extensions temporarily:** Run `cursor --disable-extensions` from the command line. If issues resolve, re-enable extensions one by one to identify the problematic one.

**Reset extension data:** Uninstall and reinstall problematic extensions to reset their stored data. Check settings for extension configuration that persists after reinstallation.

3

### Clearing app data

This deletes your app data, including extensions, themes, snippets, and installation-related data. Export your profile first to preserve this data.

Cursor stores app data outside the app for restoration between updates and reinstallations.

To clear app data:

**Windows:** Run these commands in Command Prompt:

```
rd /s /q "%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Programs\Cursor"
rd /s /q "%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Cursor"
rd /s /q "%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Cursor"
del /f /q "%USERPROFILE%\.cursor*"
rd /s /q "%USERPROFILE%\.cursor"
```

**MacOS:** Run `sudo rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/Cursor` and `rm -f ~/.cursor.json` in Terminal.

**Linux:** Run `rm -rf ~/.cursor ~/.config/Cursor/` in Terminal.

4

### Uninstalling Cursor

To uninstall Cursor:

windows

Windows

Search "Add or Remove Programs" in Start Menu, find "Cursor", click "Uninstall".

MacOS

Open Applications folder, right-click "Cursor", select "Move to Trash".

linux

Linux

**For .deb packages:** `sudo apt remove cursor`

**For .rpm packages:** `sudo dnf remove cursor` or `sudo yum remove cursor`

**For AppImage:** Delete the Cursor.appimage file from its location.

5

### Reinstalling Cursor

Reinstall from the [Downloads page](https://www.cursor.com/downloads). Without cleared app data, Cursor restores to its previous state. Otherwise, you get a fresh install.

Integrations

# GitHub

[Background Agents](https://cursor.com/docs/background-agent) and [Bugbot](https://cursor.com/docs/bugbot) require the Cursor GitHub app to clone repositories and push changes.

## [Installation](https://cursor.com/docs/integrations/github\#installation)

1. Go to [Integrations in Dashboard](https://cursor.com/dashboard?tab=integrations)
2. Click **Connect** next to GitHub
3. Choose repository either **All repositories** or **Selected repositories**

To disconnect your GitHub account, return to the integrations dashboard and click **Disconnect Account**.

## [Using Agent in GitHub](https://cursor.com/docs/integrations/github\#using-agent-in-github)

The GitHub integration enables background agent workflows directly from pull requests and issues. You can trigger an agent to read context, implement fixes, and push commits by commenting `@cursor [prompt]` on any PR or issue.

If you have [Bugbot](https://cursor.com/docs/bugbot) enabled, you can comment `@cursor fix` to read the suggested fix from Bugbot to trigger a background agent to address the issue.

## [Permissions](https://cursor.com/docs/integrations/github\#permissions)

The GitHub app requires specific permissions to work with background agents:

| Permission | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **Repository access** | Clone your code and create working branches |
| **Pull requests** | Create PRs with agent changes for your review |
| **Issues** | Track bugs and tasks that agents discover or fix |
| **Checks and statuses** | Report on code quality and test results |
| **Actions and workflows** | Monitor CI/CD pipelines and deployment status |

All permissions follow the principle of least privilege needed for background agent functionality.

## [IP Allow List Configuration](https://cursor.com/docs/integrations/github\#ip-allow-list-configuration)

If your organization uses GitHub's IP allow list feature to restrict access to your repositories, you'll need to contact support first to enable IP allowlist functionality for your team.

### [Contact Support](https://cursor.com/docs/integrations/github\#contact-support)

Before configuring IP allowlists, contact [hi@cursor.com](mailto:hi@cursor.com) to enable this feature for your team. This is required for both configuration methods below.

### [Enable IP allow list configuration for installed GitHub Apps (Recommended)](https://cursor.com/docs/integrations/github\#enable-ip-allow-list-configuration-for-installed-github-apps-recommended)

The Cursor GitHub app has the IP list already pre-configured. You can enable the allowlist for installed apps to automatically inherit this list. This is the **recommended approach**, as it allows us to update the list and your organization receives updates automatically.

To enable this:

1. Go to your organization's Security settings
2. Navigate to IP allow list settings
3. Check **"Allow access by GitHub Apps"**

For detailed instructions, see [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-security-settings-for-your-organization/managing-allowed-ip-addresses-for-your-organization#allowing-access-by-github-apps).

### [Add IPs directly to your allowlist](https://cursor.com/docs/integrations/github\#add-ips-directly-to-your-allowlist)

If your organization uses IdP-defined allowlists in GitHub or otherwise cannot use the pre-configured allowlist, you can manually add the IP addresses:

```
184.73.225.134
3.209.66.12
52.44.113.131
```

The list of IP addresses may infrequently change. Teams using IP allow lists will be given advanced notice before IP addresses are added or removed.

## [Troubleshooting](https://cursor.com/docs/integrations/github\#troubleshooting)

### Agent can't access repository

### Permission denied for pull requests

### App not visible in GitHub settings

# API Keys

Use your own API keys to send unlimited AI messages at your own cost. When configured, Cursor will use your API keys to call LLM providers directly.

To use your API key, go to `Cursor Settings` \> `Models` and enter your API keys. Click **Verify**. Once validated, your API key is enabled.

Custom API keys only work with standard chat models. Features requiring
specialized models (like Tab Completion) will continue using Cursor's built-in
models.

Cursor's [Zero Data Retention policy](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/dashboard#privacy-settings) does not apply when using your own API keys. Your data handling will be subject to the privacy policies of your chosen AI provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Azure, or AWS).

## [Supported providers](https://cursor.com/docs/settings/api-keys\#supported-providers)

- **OpenAI** \- Standard, non-reasoning chat models only. The model picker will show the OpenAI models available.
- **Anthropic** \- All Claude models available through the Anthropic API.
- **Google** \- Gemini models available through the Google AI API.
- **Azure OpenAI** \- Models deployed in your Azure OpenAI Service instance.
- **AWS Bedrock** \- Use AWS access keys, secret keys, or IAM roles. Works with models available in your Bedrock configuration.

A unique external ID is generated after validating your Bedrock IAM role, which can be added to your IAM role trust policy for additional security.

### [Why use MCP?](https://cursor.com/docs/context/mcp\#why-use-mcp)

MCP connects Cursor to external systems and data. Instead of explaining your project structure repeatedly, integrate directly with your tools.

Write MCP servers in any language that can print to `stdout` or serve an HTTP endpoint - Python, JavaScript, Go, etc.

### [How it works](https://cursor.com/docs/context/mcp\#how-it-works)

MCP servers expose capabilities through the protocol, connecting Cursor to external tools or data sources.

Cursor supports three transport methods:

| Transport | Execution environment | Deployment | Users | Input | Auth |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **`stdio`** | Local | Cursor manages | Single user | Shell command | Manual |
| **`SSE`** | Local/Remote | Deploy as server | Multiple users | URL to an SSE endpoint | OAuth |
| **`Streamable HTTP`** | Local/Remote | Deploy as server | Multiple users | URL to an HTTP endpoint | OAuth |

### [Protocol support](https://cursor.com/docs/context/mcp\#protocol-support)

Cursor supports these MCP protocol capabilities:

| Feature | Support | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Tools** | Supported | Functions for the AI model to execute |
| **Prompts** | Supported | Templated messages and workflows for users |
| **Resources** | Supported | Structured data sources that can be read and referenced |
| **Roots** | Supported | Server-initiated inquiries into URI or filesystem boundaries |
| **Elicitation** | Supported | Server-initiated requests for additional information from users |

## [Installing MCP servers](https://cursor.com/docs/context/mcp\#installing-mcp-servers)

### [One-click installation](https://cursor.com/docs/context/mcp\#one-click-installation)

Install MCP servers from our collection and authenticate with OAuth.

### [Using `mcp.json`](https://cursor.com/docs/context/mcp\#using-mcpjson)

Configure custom MCP servers with a JSON file:

CLI Server - Node.js

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "server-name": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "value"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

CLI Server - Python

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "server-name": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["mcp-server.py"],
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "value"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Remote Server

```
// MCP server using HTTP or SSE - runs on a server
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "server-name": {
      "url": "http://localhost:3000/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "API_KEY": "value"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### [STDIO server configuration](https://cursor.com/docs/context/mcp\#stdio-server-configuration)

For STDIO servers (local command-line servers), configure these fields in your `mcp.json`:

| Field | Required | Description | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **type** | Yes | Server connection type | `"stdio"` |
| **command** | Yes | Command to start the server executable. Must be available on your system path or contain its full path. | `"npx"`, `"node"`, `"python"`, `"docker"` |
| **args** | No | Array of arguments passed to the command | `["server.py", "--port", "3000"]` |
| **env** | No | Environment variables for the server | `{"API_KEY": "${env:api-key}"}` |
| **envFile** | No | Path to an environment file to load more variables | `".env"`, `"${workspaceFolder}/.env"` |

### [Using the Extension API](https://cursor.com/docs/context/mcp\#using-the-extension-api)

For programmatic MCP server registration, Cursor provides an extension API that allows dynamic configuration without modifying `mcp.json` files. This is particularly useful for enterprise environments and automated setup workflows.

[MCP Extension API Reference\\
\\
Learn how to register MCP servers programmatically using\\
`vscode.cursor.mcp.registerServer()`](https://cursor.com/docs/context/mcp-extension-api)

### [Configuration locations](https://cursor.com/docs/context/mcp\#configuration-locations)

Project Configuration

Create `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project for project-specific tools.

Global Configuration

Create `~/.cursor/mcp.json` in your home directory for tools available everywhere.

### [Config interpolation](https://cursor.com/docs/context/mcp\#config-interpolation)

Use variables in `mcp.json` values. Cursor resolves variables in these fields: `command`, `args`, `env`, `url`, and `headers`.

Supported syntax:

- `${env:NAME}` environment variables
- `${userHome}` path to your home folder
- `${workspaceFolder}` project root (the folder that contains `.cursor/mcp.json`)
- `${workspaceFolderBasename}` name of the project root
- `${pathSeparator}` and `${/}` OS path separator

Examples

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "local-server": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["${workspaceFolder}/tools/mcp_server.py"],
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "${env:API_KEY}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "remote-server": {
      "url": "https://api.example.com/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer ${env:MY_SERVICE_TOKEN}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### [Authentication](https://cursor.com/docs/context/mcp\#authentication)

MCP servers use environment variables for authentication. Pass API keys and tokens through the config.

Cursor supports OAuth for servers that require it.

## [Using MCP in chat](https://cursor.com/docs/context/mcp\#using-mcp-in-chat)

The Composer Agent automatically uses MCP tools listed under `Available Tools` when relevant. Ask for a specific tool by name or describe what you need. Enable or disable tools from settings.

### [Toggling tools](https://cursor.com/docs/context/mcp\#toggling-tools)

Enable or disable MCP tools directly from the chat interface. Click a tool name in the tools list to toggle it. Disabled tools won't be loaded into context or available to Agent.

### [Tool approval](https://cursor.com/docs/context/mcp\#tool-approval)

Agent asks for approval before using MCP tools by default. Click the arrow next to the tool name to see arguments.

![Tool confirmation prompt](https://cursor.com/docs-static/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs-static%2Fimages%2Fcontext%2Fmcp%2Ftool-confirm.png&w=1920&q=75)

#### [Auto-run](https://cursor.com/docs/context/mcp\#auto-run)

Enable auto-run for Agent to use MCP tools without asking. Works like terminal commands. Read more about Auto-run settings [here](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/tools#auto-run).

### [Tool response](https://cursor.com/docs/context/mcp\#tool-response)

Cursor shows the response in chat with expandable views of arguments and responses:

![MCP tool call result](https://cursor.com/docs-static/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs-static%2Fimages%2Fcontext%2Fmcp%2Ftool-call.png&w=1920&q=75)

### [Images as context](https://cursor.com/docs/context/mcp\#images-as-context)

MCP servers can return images - screenshots, diagrams, etc. Return them as base64 encoded strings:

```
const RED_CIRCLE_BASE64 = "/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAgEASABIAAD/2w...";
// ^ full base64 clipped for readability

server.tool("generate_image", async (params) => {
  return {
    content: [\
      {\
        type: "image",\
        data: RED_CIRCLE_BASE64,\
        mimeType: "image/jpeg",\
      },\
    ],
  };
});
```

See this [example server](https://github.com/msfeldstein/mcp-test-servers/blob/main/src/image-server.js) for implementation details. Cursor attaches returned images to the chat. If the model supports images, it analyzes them.

## [Security considerations](https://cursor.com/docs/context/mcp\#security-considerations)

When installing MCP servers, consider these security practices:

- **Verify the source**: Only install MCP servers from trusted developers and repositories
- **Review permissions**: Check what data and APIs the server will access
- **Limit API keys**: Use restricted API keys with minimal required permissions
- **Audit code**: For critical integrations, review the server's source code

Remember that MCP servers can access external services and execute code on your behalf. Always understand what a server does before installation.

## [Real-world examples](https://cursor.com/docs/context/mcp\#real-world-examples)

For practical examples of MCP in action, see our [Web Development guide](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/tools/web-development) which demonstrates integrating Linear, Figma, and browser tools into your development workflow.

# Model and Integration Management

Your team can access multiple AI models and integrate Cursor with various services. This documentation covers how to control which models are available, manage MCP server trust, and set up integrations with tools like Slack, GitHub, and Linear.

## [Model access control](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/model-and-integration-management\#model-access-control)

Enterprise teams can control which AI models team members can use. This helps manage costs, ensure appropriate usage, and comply with organizational policies.

Model access controls are configured through the [team dashboard](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/dashboard). Navigate to Settings and look for "Model Access Control" (Enterprise only).

### [How enterprise model rollout works](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/model-and-integration-management\#how-enterprise-model-rollout-works)

When new models become available, Cursor doesn't immediately enable them for all enterprise teams.

Instead, Enterprise teams can opt in to new models for their organization.

See [Models](https://cursor.com/docs/models) for the current list of available models.

## [MCP server trust management](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/model-and-integration-management\#mcp-server-trust-management)

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) lets you connect external tools and data sources to Cursor. MCP servers can:

- Read files from external systems
- Execute operations on your behalf
- Access databases and APIs
- Integrate with third-party services

MCP servers are designed and implemented by external vendors, not Cursor. We work with partners to provide a [vetted directory](https://cursor.com/docs/context/mcp/directory) of trusted servers, but you should review each server's capabilities and permissions before enabling it for your team.

Because MCP servers have significant capabilities, you need to manage which servers your team can use.

### [Allowlist and blocklist](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/model-and-integration-management\#allowlist-and-blocklist)

Enterprise teams can control MCP server access through allowlists and blocklists:

Set this in the [team dashboard](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/dashboard) under "MCP Configuration" (Enterprise only).

See [MCP](https://cursor.com/docs/context/mcp) for details on MCP servers and configuration.

## [Git repository blocklist](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/model-and-integration-management\#git-repository-blocklist)

You can prevent Cursor from accessing specific repositories.

Add repository URLs or patterns in the [team dashboard](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/dashboard) under "Repository Blocklist" (Enterprise only). Cursor will refuse to index or work with blocked repositories.

## [Integration: Slack](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/model-and-integration-management\#integration-slack)

The Slack integration enables Background Agents to run directly from Slack. Team members can mention `@cursor` with a prompt and get automated code changes delivered as pull requests.

Cursor requires permissions to read messages, post responses, and access channel metadata. See the [Slack integration documentation](https://cursor.com/docs/integrations/slack#permissions) for the full list.

See [Slack integration](https://cursor.com/docs/integrations/slack) for detailed setup and usage instructions.

## [Integration: GitHub, GHES, and GitLab](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/model-and-integration-management\#integration-github-ghes-and-gitlab)

Connect Cursor to your version control system to work with Background Agents.

Cursor requires read access to repositories and write access to create PRs. You control which repositories the Cursor app can access.

See [GitHub integration](https://cursor.com/docs/integrations/github) for setup.

## [Integration: Linear](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/model-and-integration-management\#integration-linear)

Connect Linear to start Background Agents from issues.

Cursor requires read access to issues and write access to update issue status.

See [Linear integration](https://cursor.com/docs/integrations/linear) for details.

# MCP Install Links

MCP servers can be installed with Cursor deeplinks. It uses the same format as [`mcp.json`](https://cursor.com/docs/context/mcp) with a name and transport configuration.

Install links:

```
cursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/mcp/install?name=$NAME&config=$BASE64_ENCODED_CONFIG
```

| Component | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `cursor://` | Protocol scheme |
| `anysphere.cursor-deeplink` | Deeplink handler |
| `/mcp/install` | Path |
| `name` | Query parameter for server name |
| `config` | Query parameter for base64 encoded JSON configuration |

## [Generate install link](https://cursor.com/docs/context/mcp/install-links\#generate-install-link)

1. Get name and JSON configuration of server
2. `JSON.stringify` the configuration then base64 encode it
3. Replace `$NAME` and `$BASE64_ENCODED_CONFIG` with the name and encoded config

Helper for generating links:

MCP server JSON configuration{
"postgres": {
"command": "npx",
"args": \[\
"-y",\
"@modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres",\
"postgresql://localhost/mydb"\
\]
}
}

No server detected

# Request-Based Pricing (Legacy)

This page covers Cursor's legacy request-based pricing model that was used before the transition to usage-based pricing.

## [Overview](https://cursor.com/docs/account/pricing/request-based-legacy\#overview)

The request-based pricing model charged users based on the number of AI requests made rather than token usage. Each license had a monthly allotment of requests. If you exceeded your included usage, you could purchase additional usage on-demand.

### [Request](https://cursor.com/docs/account/pricing/request-based-legacy\#request)

A request represents a single message sent to most models, which includes your message, any relevant context from your codebase, and the model's response. View the model table to see request counts for each model.

- **On-demand usage** is available at the model's API rate plus 20%.
- **Max Mode** for larger context windows is available at the model's API rate plus 20%.

## [Models](https://cursor.com/docs/account/pricing/request-based-legacy\#models)

## [Legacy customers](https://cursor.com/docs/account/pricing/request-based-legacy\#legacy-customers)

If you're on a legacy request-based plan, you can continue using it until your next renewal. At renewal, you'll be migrated to the usage-based pricing model.

## [Migration support](https://cursor.com/docs/account/pricing/request-based-legacy\#migration-support)

Our team is available to help with the transition from legacy pricing to the current model. We can provide:

- Detailed cost analysis comparing old vs new pricing

# Pricing

There are two teams plans: Teams ($40/user/mo) and Enterprise (Custom).

Team plans provide additional features like:

- Privacy Mode enforcement
- Admin Dashboard with usage stats (also accessible via [Admin API](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/admin-api))
- Centralized team billing
- SAML/OIDC SSO

We recommend Teams for any customer that is happy self-serving. We recommend [Enterprise](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise) for customers that need priority support, pooled usage, invoicing, SCIM, or advanced security controls. [Contact sales](https://cursor.com/contact-sales) to get started.

## [How pricing works](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/pricing\#how-pricing-works)

Teams pricing is usage-based. Each seat includes monthly usage, and you can continue using Cursor beyond that with on-demand usage.

### [Included usage](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/pricing\#included-usage)

Each team seat ($40/mo) comes with **$20/mo of included usage**. This usage:

- Is allocated per user (each user gets their own $20)
- Does not transfer between team members
- Resets at the start of each billing cycle
- Covers all agent requests at public list API prices + Cursor Token Fee

Our [Enterprise plan](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise) offers pooled usage shared between all users in a team. [Get in touch](https://cursor.com/contact-sales) with our team to learn more.

### [On-demand usage](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/pricing\#on-demand-usage)

When exceeding the $20 of included usage, team members automatically continue with **on-demand usage**:

- Billed monthly at the same rates (API prices + Cursor Token Fee)
- No interruption in service or quality
- Tracked per user in your admin dashboard (see [spending data API](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/admin-api#get-spending-data))
- Can be controlled with spending limits

### [Cursor Token Fee](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/pricing\#cursor-token-fee)

All non-Auto agent requests include a **$0.25 per million tokens** fee. This covers:

- Codebase indexing and search
- Custom model execution (Tab, Apply, etc.)
- Infrastructure and processing costs

This fee applies to all tokens: input, output, and cached tokens.

## [Active seats](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/pricing\#active-seats)

Cursor bills per active user, not pre-allocated seats. Add or remove users anytime and billing will adjust immediately.

Refunds appear as account credit on your next invoice. Your renewal date stays the same.

## [Spending controls](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/pricing\#spending-controls)

Teams can configure monthly team-wide spending limits, as well as optional per-user spending limits. You can manage these limits through the dashboard or programmatically via the [Admin API](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/admin-api#set-user-spend-limit).

Contact `enterprise@cursor.com` for volume discounts on larger teams.

## [Model Pricing](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/pricing\#model-pricing)

All prices are per million tokens. Teams are charged at public list API prices + [Cursor Token Fee](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/pricing#cursor-token-fee).

# Codebase Indexing

Codebase indexing enables semantic search across your local workspace files, building a searchable index for natural language queries to find relevant code across your entire codebase.

## [How it works](https://cursor.com/docs/context/codebase-indexing\#how-it-works)

Cursor transforms your code into searchable vectors through a 7-step process:

1. Your workspace files are securely synchronized with Cursor's servers to keep the index current and up-to-date.

2. Files are broken down into meaningful chunks that capture the essence of your code—functions, classes, and logical code blocks rather than arbitrary text segments.

3. Each chunk is converted into a vector representation using AI models. This creates a mathematical fingerprint that captures the semantic meaning of your code.

4. These embeddings are stored in a specialized vector database optimized for fast similarity search across millions of code chunks.

5. When you search, your query is converted into a vector using the same AI models that processed your code.

6. The system finds the most similar code chunks by comparing your query's vector against stored embeddings.

7. You get relevant code snippets with file locations and context, ranked by semantic similarity to your search.

## [Privacy and security](https://cursor.com/docs/context/codebase-indexing\#privacy-and-security)

### [Data protection](https://cursor.com/docs/context/codebase-indexing\#data-protection)

Your code's privacy is protected through multiple layers of security. File paths are encrypted before being sent to our servers, ensuring your project structure remains confidential. Your actual code content is never stored in plaintext on our servers, maintaining the confidentiality of your intellectual property. Code is only held in memory during the indexing process, then discarded, so there's no permanent storage of your source code.

## [Getting started](https://cursor.com/docs/context/codebase-indexing\#getting-started)

### [First-time indexing](https://cursor.com/docs/context/codebase-indexing\#first-time-indexing)

Indexing begins automatically when you open a workspace. The system scans your workspace structure, uploads files securely, and processes them through AI models to create embeddings. **Semantic search becomes available at 80% completion.**

## [Keeping your index updated](https://cursor.com/docs/context/codebase-indexing\#keeping-your-index-updated)

### [Automatic sync](https://cursor.com/docs/context/codebase-indexing\#automatic-sync)

Cursor automatically keeps your index synchronized with your workspace through periodic checks every 5 minutes. The system intelligently updates only changed files, removing old embeddings and creating new ones as needed. Files are processed in batches for optimal performance, ensuring minimal impact on your development workflow.

### [What gets indexed](https://cursor.com/docs/context/codebase-indexing\#what-gets-indexed)

| File Type | Action |
| --- | --- |
| New files | Automatically added to index |
| Modified files | Old embeddings removed, fresh ones created |
| Deleted files | Promptly removed from index |
| Large/complex files | May be skipped for performance |

### [Performance and troubleshooting](https://cursor.com/docs/context/codebase-indexing\#performance-and-troubleshooting)

**Performance**: Uses intelligent batching and caching for accurate, up-to-date results.

**Troubleshooting steps**:

1. Check internet connection
2. Verify workspace permissions
3. Restart Cursor
4. Contact support if issues persist

The indexing system works reliably in the background to keep your code searchable.

## [Why semantic search?](https://cursor.com/docs/context/codebase-indexing\#why-semantic-search)

While tools like `grep` and `ripgrep` are useful for finding exact string matches, semantic search goes further by understanding the meaning behind your code.

If you ask Agent to "update the top navigation", semantic search can find `header.tsx` even though the word "navigation" doesn't appear in the filename. This works because the embeddings understand that "header" and "top navigation" are semantically related.

### [Benefits over grep alone](https://cursor.com/docs/context/codebase-indexing\#benefits-over-grep-alone)

Semantic search provides several advantages:

- **Faster results**: Compute happens during indexing (offline) rather than at runtime, so Agent searches are faster and cheaper
- **Better accuracy**: Custom-trained models retrieve more relevant results than string matching
- **Fewer follow-ups**: Users send fewer clarifying messages and use fewer tokens compared to grep-only search
- **Conceptual matching**: Find code by what it does, not just what it's named

Agent uses **both** grep and semantic search together. Grep excels at finding
exact patterns, while semantic search excels at finding conceptually similar
code. This combination delivers the best results.

## [Configuration](https://cursor.com/docs/context/codebase-indexing\#configuration)

Cursor indexes all files except those in [ignore files](https://cursor.com/docs/context/ignore-files) (e.g. `.gitignore`, `.cursorignore`).

Click `Show Settings` to:

- Enable automatic indexing for new repositories
- Configure which files to ignore

[Ignoring large content files](https://cursor.com/docs/context/ignore-files) improves answer
accuracy.

### [View indexed files](https://cursor.com/docs/context/codebase-indexing\#view-indexed-files)

To see indexed file paths: `Cursor Settings` \> `Indexing & Docs` \> `View included files`

This opens a `.txt` file listing all indexed files.
