name: telos
description: Teleological physiology analysis framework for understanding biological systems through multi-constraint optimization. Use when analyzing physiological mechanisms, explaining apparent biological "inefficiencies", preparing for medical examinations (CICM/ANZCA Primary), understanding why biological systems are designed the way they are, or when seeking deeper mechanistic understanding beyond descriptive knowledge. Triggers on questions like "why is X designed this way", "what purpose does Y serve", "how is Z optimized", analysis of physiological trade-offs, or exploration of evolutionary/design constraints.

# TELOS: Teleological Physiology Framework

## Core Principle

Analyze biological systems assuming superior designer intelligence. Apparent inefficiencies are puzzles requiring deeper investigation—elegant solutions often solve multiple problems with single mechanisms.

**Epistemological stance**: Teleological reasoning is a productive heuristic, not a metaphysical claim. It generates testable predictions about system design and reveals hidden constraints.

## Methodological Framework

### λτ.ο Pattern (Purpose → Terminal → Observation)

```
λτ.ο : Constraints × Design → Optimization
     where τ = teleological purpose
           ο = observed mechanism  
           λ = transformation revealing hidden design logic
```

Every analysis follows: **Purpose → Constraints → Optimization → Mechanism**

### Three-Level Hierarchical Analysis

| Level | Focus | Key Questions |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| **Strategic (τ)** | Purpose/function | What problem does this solve? What defines "optimal" here? |
| **Tactical (λ)** | Constraint mapping | What competing constraints exist? What alternatives were rejected? |
| **Operational (ο)** | Implementation | How is this achieved molecularly/cellularly? What quantitative optimizations? |

## Core Methodology

### 1. Constraint Mapping

Identify all constraints before seeking optimization:

**Physical**: Thermodynamics, kinetics, diffusion limits, mechanical forces
**Chemical**: pH, ionic strength, molecular compatibility, reaction rates
**Energetic**: ATP cost, metabolic efficiency, heat dissipation
**Spatial**: Size limits, packing constraints, anatomical boundaries
**Temporal**: Response times, developmental sequences, diurnal rhythms

See `references/constraint-taxonomy.md` for formal classification.

### 2. Oscillating Hierarchical Analysis

```
Atomic Principles
      ↓ zoom out
First Composites (combinations)
      ↓ zoom in
Reinforce Atomic Connections
      ↓ zoom out
Higher Composites (system integration)
      ↓ ... iterate
```

Each oscillation reveals connections and reinforces semantic depth. Build efficiently on prior layers.

### 3. Multi-Constraint Optimization Detection

When apparent "flaws" appear:
1. List all constraints the system must satisfy
2. Identify which constraints conflict
3. Analyze how the "flaw" resolves the conflict
4. Quantify the optimization across all dimensions
5. Consider alternative designs and why rejected

### 4. Convergence Validation

Optimization claims require:
- **Quantitative support**: Measurable efficiency gains
- **Comparative evidence**: Similar solutions in unrelated systems
- **Predictive power**: Explains otherwise mysterious features
- **Minimal configuration**: No simpler solution satisfies all constraints

| Physical        |                     |            |
| Chemical        |                     |            |
| Energetic       |                     |            |
| Spatial         |                     |            |

### Operational: Implementation Analysis
- Molecular mechanisms:
- Quantitative optimizations:
- Integration points:

### Synthesis: Multi-Constraint Resolution
- How single mechanism solves multiple problems:
- Alternative designs considered:
- Why current design is minimal energy configuration:

### Validation
- Convergent evidence:
- Predictive implications:
- Falsifiable claims:
```

## Integration Points

### With quantitative-physiology
Leverage equations to validate optimization claims quantitatively:
- Stewart-Hamilton for cardiac output optimization
- Henderson-Hasselbalch for pH gradient analysis
- Nernst equation for membrane potential efficiency

### With hierarchical-reasoning
Map teleological levels to cognitive architecture:
- Strategic ↔ Purpose/function analysis
- Tactical ↔ Constraint identification
- Operational ↔ Mechanistic implementation

### With saq
Generate examination questions testing teleological understanding:
- Frame mechanisms within design context
- Test constraint awareness beyond fact recall

### With constraints skill
Formalize physiological constraints using:
- Deontic modalities (what is permitted/required given physics)
- Juarrero's trichotomy (enabling/governing/constitutive)

## Validation Rubrics

| Criterion | Weak | Moderate | Strong |
|-----------|------|----------|--------|
| Constraint mapping | 1-2 constraints | 3-4 constraints | 5+ constraints with interactions |
| Quantitative support | Qualitative only | Some numbers | Equation-backed |
| Alternative consideration | None | Mentioned | Analyzed why rejected |
| Predictive power | Descriptive | Explains known facts | Predicts unknown features |
| Convergence | Single example | Related systems | Phylogenetically independent |

See `references/validation-rubrics.md` for detailed scoring.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Panglossian fallacy**: Assuming everything is optimal. Some features are historical accidents or vestigial.
2. **Single-constraint thinking**: Optimizing for one constraint while ignoring trade-offs.
3. **Post-hoc rationalization**: Inventing purposes without constraint evidence.
4. **Ignoring alternatives**: Not considering why other designs were "rejected."

## Quick Reference: Analysis Triggers

Apply teleological analysis when encountering:
- "Inefficient" or "wasteful" biological processes
- Anatomical arrangements that seem suboptimal
- Redundant or apparently unnecessary mechanisms
- Extreme precision in physiological values (e.g., pH 7.4)
- Convergent evolution across unrelated lineages

## Example Analyses

See `references/case-studies.md` for worked examples:
- Intracellular pH gradient (0.6 unit differential)
- Vertebrate retinal architecture ("inverted" design)
- Renal countercurrent multiplication
- Hemoglobin cooperativity

## Clinical Applications

Pathological states as constraint violations:
- Identify which design constraint is broken
- Predict compensatory mechanisms based on design logic
- Explain therapeutic targets via intended function
- Understand why some interventions fail (violate other constraints)
