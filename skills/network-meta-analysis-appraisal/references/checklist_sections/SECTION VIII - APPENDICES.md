### Appendix B: Glossary of Terms

**Coherence/Consistency:** Agreement between direct and indirect evidence for the same comparison.

**Contribution Matrix:** Matrix showing the proportion of information each study contributes to each network estimate.

**Heterogeneity:** Variability in true treatment effects across studies beyond sampling error.

**Imprecision:** Insufficient information (wide confidence intervals) limiting certainty about treatment effects.

**Inconsistency/Incoherence:** Disagreement between direct and indirect evidence that cannot be explained by chance.

**Indirectness:** Extent to which evidence differs from the question of interest (PICO).

**Prediction Interval:** Range within which treatment effects in a new study/setting are expected to fall (accounts for between-study heterogeneity).

**Transitivity:** Assumption that effect modifiers are similarly distributed across all treatment comparisons in the network.

### Appendix C: Calculation Aids

**Optimal Information Size (OIS) for Binary Outcomes:**
OIS = 2(Zα + Zβ)² × p̄(1-p̄) / (RRR)²

**Heterogeneity Interpretation:**
- τ² < 0.04: Low heterogeneity
- τ² = 0.04-0.09: Moderate heterogeneity  
- τ² > 0.09: Substantial heterogeneity

**I² Interpretation:**
- 0-40%: Might not be important
- 30-60%: May represent moderate heterogeneity
- 50-90%: May represent substantial heterogeneity
- 75-100%: Considerable heterogeneity
