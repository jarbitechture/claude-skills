# NMA Appraisal Frameworks Overview

## Integrated Checklist Components

### PRISMA-NMA (2015)
**Purpose**: Reporting transparency and completeness
**Items**: 32 core reporting standards
**Coverage**: Sections II (items 4-29)
**Focus**: Title, abstract, methods documentation, results presentation, discussion quality

### NICE DSU TSD 7 (2012)
**Purpose**: Methodological rigor assessment
**Items**: 58 items across 4 domains
**Coverage**: Section III (items 30-33)
**Focus**: Decision problem definition, analysis methods, network-specific issues, economic modeling

### ISPOR-AMCP-NPC (2014)
**Purpose**: Relevance and credibility evaluation
**Items**: 26 quality indicators
**Coverage**: Section IV (items 34-38)
**Focus**: Evidence base quality, analysis credibility, reporting transparency, interpretation balance, conflicts of interest

### CINeMA (2020)
**Purpose**: Certainty of evidence assessment
**Domains**: 6 quality dimensions
**Coverage**: Section V (items 39-45)
**Focus**:
1. Within-study bias (risk of bias)
2. Reporting bias (publication/selective reporting)
3. Indirectness (applicability)
4. Imprecision (confidence intervals)
5. Heterogeneity (between-study variability)
6. Incoherence (inconsistency/consistency)
