## Framework Selection Guidelines

### Comprehensive Appraisal (All 6 frameworks)
**When**: Peer review, complete quality assessment, training
**Time**: 3-4 hours
**Output**: Full quality profile across all dimensions
**Recommendation**: Default for thorough appraisal

### Reporting Quality Focus (CONSORT 2025 only)
**When**: Quick assessment of reporting completeness
**Time**: 1-2 hours
**Output**: Transparency evaluation
**Limitation**: Does NOT assess validity or bias

### Bias Assessment Focus (RoB 2.0 + GRADE)
**When**: Systematic review, meta-analysis inclusion
**Time**: 1-2 hours
**Output**: Internal validity and evidence certainty
**Recommendation**: Standard for systematic reviews

### Benefits/Harms Focus (Benefits/Harms + GRADE)
**When**: Safety evaluation, risk-benefit assessment
**Time**: 1-2 hours
**Output**: Comprehensive safety profile
**Recommendation**: For safety-critical interventions

### Intervention Quality Focus (TIDieR + CONSORT selected items)
**When**: Implementation planning, replication assessment
**Time**: 1-2 hours
**Output**: Intervention replicability evaluation
**Recommendation**: For complex behavioral interventions

### Editorial Focus (RoB 2.0 + Benefits/Harms + COI)
**When**: Writing editorials, commentaries, critical analyses
**Time**: 2-3 hours
**Output**: Bias, balance, and trustworthiness assessment
**Recommendation**: Meets assignment requirements for benefits/harms/biases/COI

## Rating Scales

### Standard Rating Scale (CONSORT, TIDieR, Benefits/Harms)

| Symbol | Meaning | Description | Use When |
|--------|---------|-------------|----------|
| ✓ | Satisfactory / Adequate | Criterion met with clear evidence | Full compliance |
| ⚠ | Concerns / Partial | Partially reported or minor issues | Incomplete but present |
| ✗ | Deficiency / Inadequate | Criterion not met or major problems | Not reported or inadequate |
| N/A | Not Applicable | Criterion doesn't apply to this trial | Contextually irrelevant |

### RoB 2.0 Rating Scale

| Rating | Meaning | Use When |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Low risk | Free from bias in this domain | Adequate methods, no concerns |
| Some concerns | Potential for bias but uncertain | Incomplete information or minor issues |
| High risk | Substantial risk of bias | Serious methodological flaws |

### GRADE Certainty Levels

| Level | Symbol | Confidence | Interpretation |
|-------|--------|------------|----------------|
| High | ⊕⊕⊕⊕ | Very confident | True effect close to estimate |
| Moderate | ⊕⊕⊕⊙ | Moderately confident | May differ substantially |
| Low | ⊕⊕⊙⊙ | Limited confidence | Likely differs substantially |
| Very Low | ⊕⊙⊙⊙ | Very little confidence | Almost certainly differs |

### COI Impact Levels

| Level | Meaning | Characteristics |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| Low | Minimal influence | Academic funding, independent, transparent |
| Moderate | Potential influence | Industry funding but independent oversight |
| High | Substantial influence | Sponsor-controlled, conflicts, evidence of bias |

## Minimum Assessment Standards

### Critical Items That Must Be Assessed

**CONSORT Critical Items** (must be ✓ for acceptable reporting):
- 1a: Trial identified in title
- 8a-10: Randomization and allocation concealment
- 13a: CONSORT flow diagram
- 17a: Effect sizes with confidence intervals
- 19: Harms reporting
- 23: Trial registration

**RoB 2.0 Critical Domains** (must be Low or Some Concerns for acceptable bias profile):
- Domain 1: Randomization process
- Domain 5: Selective reporting

**GRADE Minimum** (must assess all 5 downgrading criteria):
- Risk of bias
- Inconsistency
- Indirectness
- Imprecision
- Publication bias

**TIDieR Critical Items** (must be ✓ for adequate intervention description):
- Item 4: Procedures
- Item 5: Who provided
- Item 6: Mode of delivery
- Item 8: When and how much

**Benefits/Harms Critical Items** (must assess both):
- Domain A: Benefits (at least efficacy and clinical significance)
- Domain H: Harms (at least completeness and severity)
- Domain R: Risk-benefit balance

**COI Critical Items** (must assess):
- C1: Funding source
- C2: Author disclosures
- C4: Data access and control
