# TIDieR Checklist: Template for Intervention Description and Replication

## Overview

TIDieR (Template for Intervention Description and Replication) is a checklist for reporting interventions in clinical trials. Complete intervention description enables replication, synthesis of evidence, and translation into practice.

**Purpose**: Assess completeness of intervention reporting
**Items**: 12 items covering intervention description
**Rating Scale**: ✓ (complete), ⚠ (partially reported), ✗ (not reported), N/A (not applicable)
**Scope**: Both experimental and control interventions

## Why TIDieR Matters

Poor intervention reporting prevents:
- Replication of interventions in clinical practice
- Systematic reviews and meta-analyses
- Assessment of what components work
- Training of clinicians to deliver interventions
- Comparison of interventions across trials

**Completeness is crucial for:**
- Complex behavioral interventions
- Rehabilitation interventions
- Surgical procedures
- Multicomponent interventions
- Any intervention requiring training or expertise

## TIDieR Checklist Items

### Item 1: Brief Name

**Checklist Item**: Provide the name or a phrase that describes the intervention

**Explanation**: A recognizable, concise name helps communication and indexing

**Evidence to seek:**
- Named intervention (e.g., "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia")
- NOT just generic description (e.g., "behavioral intervention")
- Name that could be used by clinicians or in databases

**Rating Guidance:**
- ✓: Specific, recognizable name provided
- ⚠: Generic name that partially identifies intervention
- ✗: No name provided, only vague description
- N/A: Rarely applicable

**Examples:**
- ✓: "Modified Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy (mCIMT)"
- ✓: "Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)"
- ⚠: "Exercise program" (too generic)
- ✗: "The intervention" (no name)

### Item 2: Why (Rationale)

**Checklist Item**: Describe any rationale, theory, or goal of the elements essential to the intervention

**Explanation**: Understanding WHY intervention is expected to work helps clinicians adapt appropriately and researchers refine theory

**Evidence to seek:**
- Theoretical basis (e.g., "based on social cognitive theory")
- Mechanism of action (e.g., "improves motor learning through repetition")
- Target of intervention (e.g., "addresses negative thought patterns")
- Goals or expected outcomes (e.g., "increase self-efficacy")

**Rating Guidance:**
- ✓: Clear rationale with theoretical basis or mechanism
- ⚠: Brief rationale without theory or mechanism
- ✗: No rationale provided
- N/A: May apply if mechanism is obvious (e.g., well-known drug)

**Examples:**
- ✓: "MBSR uses meditation and yoga to reduce stress by enhancing present-moment awareness and reducing rumination (based on mindfulness theory)"
- ⚠: "Exercise improves cardiovascular fitness" (mechanism stated but no theory)
- ✗: No rationale provided

### Item 3: What (Materials)

**Checklist Item**: Describe any physical or informational materials used in the intervention, including those provided to participants or used in intervention delivery

- ✗: No materials mentioned

### Item 4: What (Procedures)

**Checklist Item**: Describe each of the procedures, activities, and/or processes used in the intervention, including any enabling or support activities

**Explanation**: CORE item - describes what actually happens during intervention delivery

**Evidence to seek:**
- Step-by-step description of intervention activities

### Item 6: How (Mode of Delivery)

**Checklist Item**: Describe the modes of delivery (e.g., face-to-face or by some other mechanism, such as internet or telephone) of the intervention and whether it was provided individually or in a group

**Explanation**: Delivery mode affects feasibility, cost, reach, and potentially effectiveness

**Evidence to seek:**
- Individual vs group delivery
- Face-to-face vs remote (phone, video, internet, app)

- ✓: "Exercise intensity tailored to participant's baseline fitness using heart rate reserve calculation; intensity increased by 5% each week if participant tolerated session without adverse events"
- ⚠: "Tailored to individual needs" (no details on how)
- ✗: Unclear if tailoring occurred

### Item 10: Modifications

**Checklist Item**: If the intervention was modified during the course of the study, describe the changes (what, why, when, and how)

**Explanation**: Protocol deviations affect validity and replication; transparency is critical

**Evidence to seek:**
- Whether modifications occurred during trial

- ⚠: "Minor modifications made during study" (not described)
- ✗: No mention of whether modifications occurred

### Item 11: How Well (Planned)

**Checklist Item**: If intervention adherence or fidelity was assessed, describe how and by whom, and if any strategies were used to maintain or improve fidelity, describe them

**Explanation**: Intervention fidelity affects validity; knowing intended fidelity assessment helps interpret results

**Evidence to seek:**
- Whether fidelity was assessed (planned)
- How fidelity was measured (checklist, audio recording review, observation)
- Who assessed fidelity (independent rater, supervisor, self-report)
- Fidelity criteria or thresholds
- Strategies to maintain fidelity (training, supervision, feedback, monitoring)

**Rating Guidance:**
- ✓: Fidelity assessment method and maintenance strategies described
- ⚠: Fidelity mentioned but methods not fully described
- ✗: No mention of fidelity assessment
- N/A: May apply if intervention is simple and standardized

**Examples:**
- ✓: "Fidelity assessed via review of 20% randomly selected audio-recorded sessions using validated adherence checklist; therapists received monthly feedback and supervision to maintain ≥85% adherence"
- ⚠: "Therapists monitored for fidelity" (no methods described)
- ✗: No mention of fidelity

### Item 12: How Well (Actual)

**Checklist Item**: If intervention adherence or fidelity was assessed, describe the extent to which the intervention was delivered as planned

**Explanation**: Actual fidelity achieved affects interpretation; low fidelity may explain null results

**Evidence to seek:**
- Fidelity results (percentage, score)
- Provider adherence to protocol
- Participant adherence to intervention
- Deviations from intended intervention
- Comparison of planned vs actual delivery

**Rating Guidance:**
- ✓: Actual fidelity results reported with metrics
- ⚠: General statement about fidelity without metrics
- ✗: Fidelity results not reported (even if assessed)
- N/A: Applies if fidelity was not assessed (Item 11 = ✗)

**Examples:**
- ✓: "Mean therapist adherence was 89% (SD 6%) across all sessions; mean participant attendance was 10.2/12 sessions (85%); no major protocol deviations occurred"
- ⚠: "Fidelity was high" (no metrics)
- ✗: Fidelity assessed but results not reported
- N/A: Fidelity not assessed

## Control/Comparator Intervention

**IMPORTANT**: TIDieR should be applied to BOTH intervention and control arms

For control groups, report:
- Usual care: Describe what "usual care" actually included
- Placebo: Describe placebo appearance, administration, content
- Active control: Apply full TIDieR checklist to control intervention
- No treatment: Explicitly state and describe any monitoring/contact

**Common Issue**: Control groups are often poorly described, preventing assessment of contrast between arms

## Overall TIDieR Completeness Assessment

**Completeness Levels:**
- **Complete reporting**: ≥10/12 items rated ✓ (83%)
- **Adequate reporting**: 8-9/12 items rated ✓ (67-75%)
- **Incomplete reporting**: 6-7/12 items rated ✓ (50-58%)
- **Poor reporting**: <6/12 items rated ✓ (<50%)

**Critical Items** (must be ✓ for adequate reporting):
- Item 4 (Procedures) - MOST CRITICAL
- Item 8 (When and How Much - dose/duration)
- Item 5 (Who Provided)
- Item 6 (Mode of Delivery)

## Implications of Poor TIDieR Reporting

**For replication:**
- Clinicians cannot implement intervention
- Researchers cannot replicate study
- Implementation scientists cannot adapt intervention

**For synthesis:**
- Systematic reviews cannot assess intervention components
- Meta-analyses may group heterogeneous interventions
- Comparative effectiveness research is hindered

**For interpretation:**
- Cannot distinguish "intervention doesn't work" from "intervention poorly delivered"
- Cannot assess whether null results due to inadequate dose
- Cannot identify active ingredients

## Common Reporting Gaps

1. **Procedures (Item 4)**: Most commonly inadequate - vague descriptions like "cognitive therapy" without step-by-step procedures
2. **Provider training (Item 5)**: Often omits intervention-specific training
3. **Dose (Item 8)**: May report sessions but not duration or intensity
4. **Fidelity (Items 11-12)**: Frequently not assessed or not reported
5. **Control arm**: Often minimal description of what control group received

## Intervention Types Requiring Particularly Detailed TIDieR

**Complex behavioral interventions:**
- Cognitive behavioral therapy
- Lifestyle interventions (diet, exercise, smoking cessation)
- Self-management programs
- Health promotion interventions

**Rehabilitation interventions:**
- Physiotherapy protocols
- Occupational therapy interventions
- Speech therapy
- Exercise rehabilitation

**Surgical/procedural interventions:**
- Surgical techniques
- Device implantation
- Injection procedures
- Diagnostic procedures

**Implementation interventions:**
- Quality improvement interventions
- De-implementation strategies
- Clinical decision support systems
