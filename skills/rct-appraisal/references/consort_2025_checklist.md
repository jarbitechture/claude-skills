# CONSORT 2025 Checklist for RCT Reporting

## Overview

The CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) 2025 statement provides an evidence-based minimum set of recommendations for reporting randomized controlled trials. This checklist ensures transparency, completeness, and reproducibility of RCT reporting.

**Purpose**: Assess reporting transparency and completeness
**Items**: 25 items across 7 sections
**Rating Scale**: ✓ (adequate), ⚠ (partially reported), ✗ (not reported), N/A (not applicable)

## CONSORT 2025 Checklist Items

### Section A: Title and Abstract

| Item | Sub-item | Checklist Item | Evidence to Seek |

| 1a | - | Identification as a randomised trial in the title | Title explicitly mentions "randomized" or "randomised" |
| 1b | - | Structured summary of trial design, methods, results, and conclusions | Abstract follows CONSORT structure with clear subsections |

**Assessment Notes:**
- Item 1a is CRITICAL - many databases index by title keywords
- Item 1b should include: objective, design, setting, participants, interventions, outcome measures, results (with numbers and effect sizes), conclusions
- Structured abstracts improve clarity and searchability

### Section B: Introduction

| Item | Sub-item | Checklist Item | Evidence to Seek |
|------|----------|----------------|------------------|
| 2a | - | Scientific background and explanation of rationale | Introduction provides context for why trial was needed |
| 2b | - | Specific objectives or hypotheses | Clear statement of primary objective and hypothesis |

**Assessment Notes:**
- Item 2a should reference existing literature and identify knowledge gaps
- Item 2b should specify whether hypothesis is superiority, non-inferiority, or equivalence

### Section C: Methods - Sample Size

| Item | Sub-item | Checklist Item | Evidence to Seek |
|------|----------|----------------|------------------|
| 7a | - | How sample size was determined | Power calculation with assumptions (effect size, alpha, beta, dropout) |
| 7b | - | When applicable, explanation of any interim analyses and stopping guidelines | Pre-specified stopping rules or statement that none used |

**Assessment Notes:**

| 10 | - | Who generated the random allocation sequence, who enrolled participants, and who assigned participants to interventions | Role separation documented |

**Assessment Notes:**
- Items 8-10 are CRITICAL for assessing selection bias risk
- Item 9 (allocation concealment) is often confused with blinding but is distinct
- Item 10 should show separation of roles to prevent manipulation

|------|----------|----------------|------------------|
| 11a | - | If done, who was blinded after assignment to interventions (e.g., participants, care providers, those assessing outcomes) and how | Clear statement of who was blinded using standardized terms |
| 11b | - | If relevant, description of the similarity of interventions | Placebo description or blinding maintenance methods |

**Assessment Notes:**
- Item 11a: Use standardized terms (single-blind, double-blind, triple-blind) or describe explicitly
- Item 11b: For drug trials, describe placebo matching; for behavioral interventions, describe blinding strategies
- "Open-label" should be explicitly stated if no blinding

### Section C: Methods - Statistical Methods

|------|----------|----------------|------------------|
| 12a | - | Statistical methods used to compare groups for primary and secondary outcomes | Named statistical tests (t-test, chi-square, regression, etc.) |
| 12b | - | Methods for additional analyses, such as subgroup analyses and adjusted analyses | Pre-specified vs exploratory analyses distinguished |

**Assessment Notes:**
- Item 12a should include: intention-to-treat vs per-protocol, handling of missing data

**Assessment Notes:**
- Item 13a: CONSORT flow diagram is gold standard
- Item 13b: Should report: lost to follow-up, withdrew consent, protocol violations, etc.
- Differential attrition between groups is a RED FLAG

### Section D: Results - Recruitment

### Section D: Results - Numbers Analysed

| Item | Sub-item | Checklist Item | Evidence to Seek |
|------|----------|----------------|------------------|
| 16 | - | For each group, number of participants (denominator) included in each analysis and whether the analysis was by original assigned groups | Denominators reported for each outcome + ITT statement |

**Assessment Notes:**
- CRITICAL: Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis strongly preferred
- Deviations from ITT (modified ITT, per-protocol) should be justified

### Section D: Results - Outcomes and Estimation

| Item | Sub-item | Checklist Item | Evidence to Seek |
|------|----------|----------------|------------------|
| 17a | - | For each primary and secondary outcome, results for each group, and the estimated effect size and its precision (e.g., 95% confidence interval) | Point estimates + 95% CI for all outcomes |
| 17b | - | For binary outcomes, presentation of both absolute and relative effect sizes is recommended | Risk difference AND risk ratio (or odds ratio) |

**Assessment Notes:**
- Item 17a: MUST include confidence intervals, not just p-values
- Item 17b: Absolute measures (NNT) are more clinically interpretable than relative measures

### Section D: Results - Ancillary Analyses

| Item | Sub-item | Checklist Item | Evidence to Seek |
|------|----------|----------------|------------------|
| 18 | - | Results of any other analyses performed, including subgroup analyses and adjusted analyses, distinguishing pre-specified from exploratory | Subgroup analyses labeled as pre-specified or post-hoc |

### Section D: Results - Harms

| Item | Sub-item | Checklist Item | Evidence to Seek |
|------|----------|----------------|------------------|
| 19 | - | All important harms or unintended effects in each group | Adverse events table with severity, relationship, frequency |

**Assessment Notes:**

| 21 | - | Generalisability (external validity, applicability) of the trial findings | Discussion of to whom results apply |
| 22 | - | Interpretation consistent with results, balancing benefits and harms, and considering other relevant evidence | Balanced conclusions without overstatement |

**Assessment Notes:**
- Item 20: Authors should acknowledge limitations, not just defend study
- Item 21: Restrictive eligibility criteria limit generalizability
- Item 22: Conclusions should not overstate findings or ignore non-significant results

### Section F: Other Information
