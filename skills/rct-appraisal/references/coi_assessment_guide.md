# Conflicts of Interest (COI) Assessment Guide for RCTs

## Overview

Conflicts of interest can bias study design, conduct, analysis, and reporting. Systematic COI assessment identifies potential sources of bias and their impact on study credibility.

**Purpose**: Identify and assess impact of financial and non-financial conflicts of interest
**Items**: 8 assessment criteria
**Impact Levels**: Low / Moderate / High
**Principle**: Transparency is necessary but not sufficient - assess actual impact

## Why COI Assessment Matters

**Evidence of COI impact:**
- Industry-funded trials are 3-4× more likely to report favorable results
- Author financial ties associated with positive framing of results
- Selective outcome reporting more common with industry funding
- Ghost authorship and hidden conflicts undermine scientific integrity

**Regulatory requirements:**
- ICMJE mandates COI disclosure for all authors
- Tripartite forms required for industry-sponsored trials
- Clinical trial registration must include funding source

## COI Assessment Criteria

### Item C1: Funding Source Transparency

**Criterion**: Is the funding source clearly disclosed?

**Assessment:**
- Primary funding source identified (industry, government, foundation, academic)
- If industry-funded: specific company named
- If multi-source: all sources listed with proportions
- Funder role in study described

**Rating:**
- ✓: Full disclosure with funder identified
- ⚠: Partial disclosure (e.g., "industry-supported" without naming company)
- ✗: No funding disclosure
- N/A: Rarely applicable

**Transparency Indicators:**
- Funding statement in manuscript
- Grant numbers provided
- Multiple funders disclosed
- "No funding received" explicitly stated if unfunded

**RED FLAGS:**
- No funding statement
- Vague statements ("supported by grants")
- Undisclosed pharmaceutical company involvement when drug trial

### Item C2: Author Financial Disclosures

**Criterion**: Are author financial relationships with relevant commercial entities disclosed?

**Assessment:**
- All authors' conflicts disclosed (not just first/senior)
- Specific relationships described (consulting, honoraria, stock, patents, employment)
- Amounts disclosed (if required by journal)
- Time period specified (within 3 years typical)

**Rating:**
- ✓: Comprehensive disclosure for all authors with specifics
- ⚠: Generic disclosure (e.g., "Dr. X has consulted for industry") without details
- ✗: Incomplete disclosure or missing for some authors
- N/A: All authors declare no conflicts (must verify plausibility)

**Common Financial Relationships:**
- Employment or leadership position
- Consulting fees
- Honoraria for lectures
- Stock or stock options
- Patent royalties
- Expert testimony fees
- Research funding
- Travel/accommodation reimbursement

**Disclosure Standards:**
- **ICMJE Form**: Standard disclosure form required by major journals
- **Threshold**: Typically $10,000 or >5% stock ownership
- **Time period**: Usually 36 months preceding submission

**RED FLAGS:**
- Key opinion leaders with extensive industry ties
- First/last authors with direct financial interest in intervention
- Undisclosed company employment (discoverable via web search)
- Patent holders on trial of their own invention

### Item C3: Industry Involvement in Design

**Criterion**: What role did industry sponsor play in study design and protocol?

**Assessment:**
- Study designed independently or by industry?
- Protocol developed by academic investigators vs sponsor?
- Industry input limited to product supply vs design control?
- Independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) used?

**Impact Level:**
- **Low**: Industry provided product only; no design input
- **Moderate**: Industry collaborated on design with academic oversight
- **High**: Industry designed study; academics executed

**Key Questions:**
- Who selected the primary outcome?
- Who designed the randomization scheme?
- Who determined sample size?
- Who wrote the protocol?
- Was protocol available publicly before enrollment?

**Bias Mechanisms:**
- Choice of comparator (placebo vs active; suboptimal dosing of active comparator)
- Outcome selection (choose outcome favoring intervention)
- Population selection (exclude patients likely not to benefit)
- Statistical plan favoring sponsor product

### Item C4: Data Access and Control

**Criterion**: Who had access to complete trial data? Who controlled data analysis?

**Assessment:**
- Independent statistical analysis by academics vs sponsor-controlled
- Authors had access to complete raw data vs summary only
- Contract allowed publication regardless of results?
- Authors controlled manuscript content?

**Impact Level:**
- **Low**: Full data access by independent statisticians; guaranteed publication rights
- **Moderate**: Shared analysis with sponsor input but academic final control
- **High**: Sponsor controlled data and analysis; publication gag clause

**Critical Indicators:**
- "All authors had full access to data" statement
- Independent statistical analysis plan pre-specified
- No publication gag clauses in contracts
- Authors controlled final manuscript

**RED FLAGS:**
- Sponsor performed analysis; authors received summary tables only
- Contract required sponsor approval for publication
- Delayed publication (suggests sponsor delayed negative results)
- "Data available upon request" (often means no independent access)

### Item C5: Statistical Analysis Independence

**Criterion**: Who conducted statistical analysis? Was analysis independent?

**Assessment:**
- Statistician employment (academic vs sponsor employee)
- Statistical analysis plan pre-registered
- Independent oversight (DSMB, steering committee)
- Post-hoc analyses clearly labeled

**Impact Level:**
- **Low**: Independent academic statistician with pre-specified plan
- **Moderate**: Sponsor statistician with independent verification
- **High**: Sponsor statistician only; no independent verification

**Analysis Integrity Markers:**
- Statistical analysis plan (SAP) pre-registered
- Independent statistician acknowledgment
- DSMB with independent statisticians
- Sensitivity analyses pre-specified

**RED FLAGS:**
- Sponsor employees as sole statisticians
- No SAP or SAP written post-hoc
- Multiple undeclared post-hoc analyses
- Favorable analytic choices (per-protocol over ITT, last-observation-carried-forward)

### Item C6: Interpretation Bias

**Criterion**: Is results interpretation balanced or biased toward sponsor interests?

**Assessment:**
- Conclusions match results (not overstated)
- Limitations acknowledged honestly
- Negative results discussed openly
- Alternative explanations considered
- Competing interests acknowledged in Discussion

**Impact Level:**
- **Low**: Balanced interpretation consistent with results
- **Moderate**: Minor spin but generally accurate
- **High**: Misleading interpretation favoring sponsor

**Spin Indicators:**
- Focus on positive secondary outcomes when primary negative
- Emphasis on subgroup benefits without interaction tests
- Minimization of harms ("generally well-tolerated")
- Claims of superiority without direct comparison
- Ignoring or dismissing negative findings

**Objective Assessment:**
- Do Conclusions reflect Results section findings?
- Are limitations substantive or perfunctory?
- Is clinical significance inflated?
- Are alternative explanations dismissed prematurely?

### Item C7: Ghost Authorship

**Criterion**: Is there evidence of ghost authorship or honorary authorship?

**Assessment:**
- All contributors meeting authorship criteria are listed?
- Medical writers disclosed with role described?
- Professional writing assistance acknowledged?
- Industry employees listed if substantial contribution?

**Impact Level:**
- **Low**: Full transparency; all contributors appropriately acknowledged
- **Moderate**: Medical writer involvement disclosed but role unclear
- **High**: Suspected ghost authorship or honorary authorship

**Ghost Authorship Defined:**
- Substantial contribution by individual (often industry employee or hired writer) not disclosed as author
- Common in industry-sponsored trials
- Violates authorship ethics (ICMJE, COPE)

**Honorary Authorship Defined:**
- Named author who did not meet authorship criteria
- Gift authorship for prestige or credibility
- Also violates ethics but less directly biases results

**Detection Methods:**
- Compare writing style to other manuscripts
- Check clinical trial registry for listed investigators
- Review acknowledgments for undisclosed substantial contributors
- Cross-reference presentations at conferences

**RED FLAGS:**
- Professional medical writer as sole acknowledged support
- No methodology expert among authors
- Key investigators from trial registry not listed as authors
- Suspiciously polished writing for complex trial

### Item C8: Overall COI Impact Assessment

**Criterion**: What is the overall impact of conflicts on study credibility?

**Synthesis**: Integrate all COI domains to judge overall impact

**Impact Level:**

**Low Impact:**
- Academic or government funding only
- No author financial conflicts or minor consulting fees only
- Independent protocol development, data analysis, and interpretation
- Transparent disclosure
- No evidence of bias

**Moderate Impact:**
- Industry funding with transparent disclosure
- Some author financial conflicts but not all key authors
- Collaborative design with academic control
- Independent data access but sponsor involvement in analysis
- Balanced interpretation despite potential for bias

**High Impact:**
- Industry funding with inadequate disclosure
- Multiple key authors with substantial financial conflicts
- Sponsor-controlled design, data, and analysis
- Evidence of interpretation bias or selective reporting
- Ghost authorship suspected
- Results favor sponsor product despite borderline findings

**Critical Judgment:**
- Does COI pattern suggest risk of bias in this specific trial?
- Are there specific findings that raise concern (e.g., selective outcome reporting, spin)?
- How confident can we be in the results given COI pattern?

## GRADE Consideration: COI and Risk of Bias

**COI influences GRADE risk of bias rating:**

**High COI + Favorable results** → Consider downgrading for risk of bias
- Example: Industry-funded trial with sponsor-controlled analysis showing borderline significant benefit → Serious concern for bias

**High COI + Unfavorable results** → Usually NOT downgraded
- Example: Industry-funded trial showing no benefit → Industry would not bias AGAINST their product; likely valid

**Independence and transparency mitigate concerns:**
- Pre-registered protocol and analysis plan
- Independent DSMB and data analysis
- Full data transparency

## Managing COI in Appraisal

**Interpretation Strategies:**

1. **Assess plausibility**: Do results make mechanistic sense? Are they consistent with class effects?

2. **Triangulate evidence**: Do independent trials show similar results? Are findings replicated?

3. **Scrutinize subgroups**: Are positive subgroup findings pre-specified or post-hoc?

4. **Evaluate harms**: Are adverse events fully reported or downplayed?

5. **Check registration**: Do reported outcomes match registered outcomes?

6. **Consider magnitude**: Is effect size modest (borderline, easy to bias) or large (harder to fabricate)?

**Use in Editorial/Commentary Writing:**
- Acknowledge COI patterns explicitly
- Discuss potential for bias without accusing authors
- Call for independent replication
- Note limitations for guideline development
