# Troubleshooting

Discover solutions to common issues with Claude Code installation and usage.

## Common installation issues

### Windows installation issues: errors in WSL

You might encounter the following issues in WSL:

**OS/platform detection issues**: If you receive an error during installation, WSL may be using Windows `npm`. Try:

* Run `npm config set os linux` before installation
* Install with `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code --force --no-os-check` (Do NOT use `sudo`)

**Node not found errors**: If you see `exec: node: not found` when running `claude`, your WSL environment may be using a Windows installation of Node.js. You can confirm this with `which npm` and `which node`, which should point to Linux paths starting with `/usr/` rather than `/mnt/c/`. To fix this, try installing Node via your Linux distribution's package manager or via [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

**nvm version conflicts**: If you have nvm installed in both WSL and Windows, you may experience version conflicts when switching Node versions in WSL. This happens because WSL imports the Windows PATH by default, causing Windows nvm/npm to take priority over the WSL installation.

You can identify this issue by:

* Running `which npm` and `which node` - if they point to Windows paths (starting with `/mnt/c/`), Windows versions are being used
* Experiencing broken functionality after switching Node versions with nvm in WSL

To resolve this issue, fix your Linux PATH to ensure the Linux node/npm versions take priority:

**Primary solution: Ensure nvm is properly loaded in your shell**

The most common cause is that nvm isn't loaded in non-interactive shells. Add the following to your shell configuration file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.):

```bash  theme={null}
