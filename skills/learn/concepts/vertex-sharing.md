# Vertex Sharing

> New knowledge integrates via shared vertices with existing PKM. No orphan islands allowed.

## Delegated Invariant

This concept delegates to the **shared vertex-sharing operation** to eliminate redundancy between learn and lambda-skill.

**See**: [`~/.claude/skills/shared/vertex-sharing.md`](../../shared/vertex-sharing.md)

The shared vertex-sharing operation provides the complete implementation of:
- Integration invariant: `shared_vertices ≠ ∅`
- Connectivity ratio calculation (target ≥ 0.15)
- Bridge creation strategies (direct, analogical, metaphorical)
- Graph connectivity validation

## Principle

Every new piece of knowledge must connect to existing knowledge via shared vertices. See the [shared vertex-sharing operation](../../shared/vertex-sharing.md) for full implementation details.

## Why This Matters

- Prevents knowledge islands
- Enables retrieval via multiple paths
- Builds associative memory

## Graph

**λ.out** (enables): [Κ-monotonicity](knowledge-monotonicity.md), [integrate op](../operations/integrate.md)
**λ.kin** (related): [schema-evolution](schema-evolution.md), [shared vertex-sharing](../../shared/vertex-sharing.md)
**τ.goal**: shared_vertices≠∅
